## What should I do if the widget does not appear on my website?

Is your widget not appearing on your site? There are a few reasons why this may happen.

**The Widget is not Published**

Click the Publish button to make your widget visible on your website. ![screenshot](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/892333921/c45c07305f88013f1aa40982/image.png)

**The widget is set to Appear on the Wrong Address**

1. Navigate to Rules.
2. Go to Pages. Check if your widget is set on specific pages. If it's set to specific pages but empty or includes the wrong address - the Tolstoy will not appear. If you want your widget to appear in a specific address, make sure that the correct address is pasted. Click on Save. ![screenshot](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/892335839/2796714ff88f00087b4ad4ce/image.png)

**Widget Code isn't Pasted / Posted in the Wrong Place**

Make sure that the Tolstoy code is pasted in its entirety and in the header of your site! And make sure to click the complete button on the installation page once you're done. ![screenshot](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/892427207/f148d47f5709171f132e9daf/image.png)
