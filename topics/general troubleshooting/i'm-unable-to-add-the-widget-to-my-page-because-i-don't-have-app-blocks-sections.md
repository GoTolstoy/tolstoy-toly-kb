## I'm unable to add the widget to my page because I don't have app blocks/sections.

If you don’t see any app blocks or sections, you may need to add your Tolstoy widget via code. You can watch a tutorial [here](https://share.synthesia.io/bd6215d0-bc3b-40de-8487-0d1a2e6a5997) or follow the below instructions:

1. In your Tolstoy Dashboard to Onsite > select the Tolstoy project you created > click the “Publish” button on the top right > click the “Use code instead” dropdown and click “Copy code”

2. Once you copied the code, go to your Shopify admin > Online Store > Themes > click on the three dots of the theme where you want to add the Tolstoy video > click Edit code

3. You now need to find the file of the page where you want to add the Tolstoy. If you’re adding it in a product page, the file name is product-template.liquid. If you don’t find that file, you may need to ask a help from your dev team.

4. Once you have found the file, paste the code snippet from Tolstoy in yo code line where you want the Tolstoy video to appear the Tolstoy video and hit Save.
