## I am having trouble tagging more than 10 products to my videos.

Want to use Shopify tags for your products? Just give us a heads up, and we'll set it up for you. Remember to enter the tags exactly as they are on Shopify, including the case. This ensures your videos show up on the right product pages. So, as long as your chosen products share a common Shopify tag, they'll all be tagged together. This is only for Shopify platforms
