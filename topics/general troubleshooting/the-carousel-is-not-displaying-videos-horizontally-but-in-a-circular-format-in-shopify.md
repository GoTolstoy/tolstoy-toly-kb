## The carousel is not displaying videos horizontally, but in a circular format in Shopify.

Please check your homepage Shopify theme. It's most likely that you've added "Tolstoy stories" instead of "Tolstoy carousel" block/section. Please also check the ID used - make sure it's the ID for the carousel and not for stories.
