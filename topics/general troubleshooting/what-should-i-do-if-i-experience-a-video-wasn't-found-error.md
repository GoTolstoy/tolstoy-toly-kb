## What should I do if I experience a "Video wasn't found" error?

Check if the video was properly saved. This error can happen if you exited the page too soon while it was still loading. Wait for the video to finish saving before leaving the page, or try refreshing the page to speed up the process. If the issue persists, you might need to record the video again.
