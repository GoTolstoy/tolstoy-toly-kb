## How can I integrate Tolstoy with Wix?

1. Download the Tolstoy app from the Wix App Market (https://www.wix.com/app-market/tolstoy-interactive-video) - as soon as you're done installing, you're good to go!
2. Now that your account is integrated, you can add your Tolstoy as a widget or embed it into your Wix site.
