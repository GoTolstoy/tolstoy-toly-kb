## How do I display my widget to multiple Shopify stores?

At Tolstoy, we understand that businesses operate with multiple stores. To help you manage all stores in one place, weâ€™ve made it possible to connect your Tolstoy app to multiple Shopify stores.

If you need to use the same widget across multiple stores, you can display it in those stores with no extra work. 

Here's how to do it:

1. Install the Tolstoy app in your Shopify stores.
2. On the Tolstoy app/dashboard, click the dropdown option to access your stores in the upper left corner.

3. In the Onsite tab, click the Tolstoy project/video you want to use, click the three dots, and then Export to Store.
