## Connecting Multiple Instagram Accounts
When managing multiple Shopify stores in your Tolstoy account, connecting each store to a separate Instagram account requires careful setup. Here are the steps to ensure each Instagram account connects to the correct Shopify store:
1. Ensure each Instagram account is linked to a unique Facebook Business Page.
2. In Tolstoy's Library, hover over Instagram and click the + Connect button for the store you wish to link.
3. Follow the redirection to the Meta page and select the appropriate business page linked to the Instagram you want to connect.
4. If an Instagram account is already connected and needs to be changed, click the X button next to the IG username to disconnect, then repeat the connection process for the correct account.
5. Confirm each connection separately to avoid linking errors.
By following these steps, you can manage multiple Instagram integrations without overlap, ensuring each store promotes its products effectively on the correct social media channel.
