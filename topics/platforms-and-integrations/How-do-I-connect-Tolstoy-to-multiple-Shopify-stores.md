## How do I connect Tolstoy to multiple Shopify stores?

At Tolstoy, we understand that businesses operate with multiple stores. To help you manage all stores in one place, weâ€™ve made it possible to connect your Tolstoy app to multiple Shopify stores.

If you need to use the same widget across multiple stores, you can display it in those stores with no extra work. 

Here's how to do it:
Install the Tolstoy app in your Shopify stores.

On the Tolstoy app/dashboard, click the dropdown option to access your stores in the upper left corner. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/918421941/76cff4755762054dbcbe23a3/image.png)
In the Onsite tab > Click the Tolstoy project/video you want to use, click the three dots, and then Export to Store. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/918422919/63a23873fe5693a14a413dfa/image.png)
You will be routed to a page wherein you need to choose which store you would like to export. Click next. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/918425408/d5a4503d8be32918c20e359d/image.png)
Paste the product URL if you want to show one. 
Or click "Next Step" if there are no links or products to review.
You may also edit the rules. 
Go to the other store to see your Tolstoy. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/918432288/4b1b1b07a05885a29e1a07c0/image.png)
