## How do I embed a carousel in a blog post?

In the Tolstoy App, click the Onsite tab Choose the stories or carousel you want to embed.
​Click the dropdown alongside the pause (if it’s live) or Publish (if it’s a draft) button and “Use code instead”. ​
Copy the code and click ‘Done’ if it’s not published yet.
Go to your Shopify Blog Posts section and choose the blog post you want the Tolstoy to appear in.
Click on Show HTML.
Paste the copied code where you want the Tolstoy to appear.
Save
Done! The carousel will appear only on the chosen blog post.
