6. Now, it's time to set up your second action. In your app event, choose Zendesk. If this is your first time using Zendesk in Zapier, you will need to integrate it by selecting your Zendesk account and putting the API key in Zapier, as per their instructions. In the action event, choose Create Ticket.
