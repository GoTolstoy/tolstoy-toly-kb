In your Tolstoy dashboard, go to Responses tab to view all user responses.

 After hitting reply by video, you can record another video of yourself to reply to your user and click Save to send this video back to them. 
 This is what the video reply will look like in their email! From here, your users can select View reply to watch the video you sent back to them. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/400300037/d7841127a378c9747da57930/image.png)
