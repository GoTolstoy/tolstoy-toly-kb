## How do Slider Arrows in Desktop Carousel work?

The slider arrow feature enhances navigation within your desktop carousel, providing users with an intuitive way to explore multiple videos. 

It's important to note that the slider arrow functionality is exclusive to desktop devices and is not visible on mobile. On mobile, videos are swipeable, aligning with the standard mobile behavior.

Desktop Slider Arrow Behavior
When viewing the carousel on a desktop, the slider arrow will only be visible under specific conditions. If you have a total of, for example, 4 videos in the carousel and the "items per row" setting is below 4, the slider arrows will appear. These arrows serve as an indication that there are additional videos beyond the currently visible ones, prompting users to explore further.

No Slider Arrows
Following the total of 4 videos for the carousel example, if the "items per row" setting is set to 4 or higher, the slider arrows will not be displayed. This ensures a seamless user experience by eliminating unnecessary navigation elements when the content is already fully visible on the screen.
