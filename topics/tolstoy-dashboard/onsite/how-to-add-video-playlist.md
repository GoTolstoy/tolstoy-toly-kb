## How to add video playlist

1. Navigate to your Library and click the **+ Playlist** button next to each video you'd like to include. You can either create a new playlist by typing its name or choose from existing ones. Once you've added videos to your playlist in the Library, they will automatically appear in the 'Onsite' section under the 'Videos' tab of your video layout.
