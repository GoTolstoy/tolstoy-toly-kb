## How does "Allow Non Tagged Videos" Playlist work?

The **Allow Non Tagged Videos** playlist allows all videos that align with the selected playlists on the PDP to be included in your stories, whether they are product-tagged or not. (screenshot image: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/937575652/2b014b441dab8897b8b71c9c/image.png)

If you don't want all the videos to show and just display the right videos on the product pages, make sure you don't use this playlist. Only use the **Product Tagged** playlist instead. (screenshot image: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/937574798/ced9d9f69cb257613bc250b0/image.png)
