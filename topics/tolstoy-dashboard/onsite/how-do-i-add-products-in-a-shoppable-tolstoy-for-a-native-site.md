## How do I add products in a shoppable Tolstoy for a native site?

Make sure that youâ€™ve uploaded a CSV file on the Installation section (https://help.gotolstoy.com/en/articles/8212545-how-to-upload-csv-file-for-native-site)!


Click the Onsite -> Create Tolstoy.
You can choose Product page stories, Homepage spotlight (carousel), or 'For you' video feed (aka TV Page). Then click "Start creating".
You can also choose "Create from scratch" if you prefer Widget, Hero or Embed.
Once you've chosen your video layout, go to the Library section and start tagging products.
Now your videos are shoppable!
