What are Tolstoy responses? 

Publishing your Tolstoy is only half of the story - the second stage is to manage the responses you receive. Keep track of user interactions, and responses you receive to your Tolstoys, and respond back to your viewers!

Navigate to the Responses tab of the Tolstoy you want to check. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/783654786/764e93ad59a5268ec98140db/image.png)

Each response can be marked as Read/unread, Archive, or you can even report it as Spam.

This is the same page that is seen when recording a video for your Tolstoy! You can choose to record a new video, record your screen, upload a video from your computer storage, or choose a video that you have already uploaded for a different Tolstoy. Plus, you can even import from TikTok or Instagram.

Click Save once you are ready, and your viewer will receive an email notification that they have been responded to. (screenshot image: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/783674935/4985c10225a76baa1dc1093a/image.png)
