To add videos to your stories onsite, you must be on the Pro plan or higher. Here are the steps to successfully add videos:

1. Ensure you are subscribed to the Pro plan. If not, consider upgrading to access this feature.
2. To add videos to your stories, navigate to your dashboard and select the 'Stories' option.
3. Click on 'Add Video' and select the video files you wish to upload.

   - Column 2: Product Name
   - Column 3: Product URL
   - Additional columns can include other product details as needed.
5. Once your CSV file is prepared, upload it through the dashboard to tag your products appropriately.
