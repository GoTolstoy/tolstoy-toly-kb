What are Labels and Playlists for Automatic Feeds?

Setting up these automatic feeds comes in two parts:

Setting Your Playlists
Publishing & Launching

Part 1: Set video playlists (screenshot images of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/941631183/e5cccf2f2f185495d1543e44/image.png & https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/941638540/ed6983302ce49d09904d1f9f/image.png)
Go to your Tolstoy video library. (Tolstoy Dashboard > Library section)
Click on the plus sign in a video from the video library. It is located under the Products option.
Add your playlists to each video. You can give each video one or more playlists.

Tip: The playlists should be related to the content in the video and which page you want it to be seen on i.e. homepage, products page, collections page, etc.

Think of creating playlists the same way you create hashtags for Instagram: you’re free to make any playlists you want, but it’s helpful to make ones that relate to the content and allow you to group several of your videos together.

Part 2: Set your Playlists - After you’ve labeled your videos, you can set playlists for specific videos to be shown on specific pages of your ecommerce store, like the home page, products page, collections page, and more. Playlists can be added to existing automated Tolstoys.

In your Tolstoy Dashboard, click on Onsite. Then select either Story or Carousel. 
Tip: The default playlist is “Product tagged”. This refers to all of the videos that have a product tag on them. This is a product tag, NOT a native label. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/941643301/495149ee779b1db5d63c782d/image.png)
You can add more playlists to include specifically labeled videos in your automated Tolstoy. You can add the playlist you want based on your labels that you’ve already created in your Tolstoy video library. 
Tip: You can also edit individual videos that show up in the automated pool of videos(preview section). Simply click on the individual video and you can add or delete products that have been tagged in the video.

When you are finished, click Save in the top right corner. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/941649998/d542f8e17cf43329531acbd8/image.png)

After completing all steps, you are now ready to publish and launch your Tolstoy on your website.
