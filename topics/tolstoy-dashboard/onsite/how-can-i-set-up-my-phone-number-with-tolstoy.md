## Integrating Phone Number with Help Widget
To enhance user interaction through the help widget, you can integrate the phone number setup as follows:

1. Ensure your phone number is set up as described above.
2. In the help widget settings, link the 'Call to Action' to trigger a phone call using the 'tel:' protocol.
3. Provide clear instructions in the widget for users to initiate the call.

This integration allows users to directly call from the help widget, enhancing the interactive experience and providing immediate assistance.

## Important Clarification
Please note that the help widget itself cannot automatically dial or initiate a phone call. It can be configured to include a clickable link that users can use to initiate a phone call manually. This setup ensures compliance with user interaction standards and respects user autonomy in initiating calls.
