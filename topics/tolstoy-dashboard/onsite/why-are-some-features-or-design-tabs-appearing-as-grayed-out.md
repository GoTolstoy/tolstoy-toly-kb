## Why are some features/design tabs appearing as grayed out?

The reason why you're seeing the features in the app as grayed out is because you are on the free plan. Feel free to start your 14 day trial to explore and enjoy other features.

If already in a Pro plan or higher - you might be editing a Spotlight carousel. It's a version of Carousel where the design is grayed out by default, you can switch it back to the default carousel and the design will not be grayed out anymore.
