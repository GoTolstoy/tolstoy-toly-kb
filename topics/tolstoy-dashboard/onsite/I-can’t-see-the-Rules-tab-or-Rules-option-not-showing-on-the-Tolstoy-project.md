## I canâ€™t see the Rules tab or Rules option not showing on the Tolstoy project.

The Rules tab won't show on the "Automated" widget. This layout will depend on the video condition you set. You can tag products first on the "Videos" section on the left panel and it will automatically filter the product page where the widget will be displayed.
