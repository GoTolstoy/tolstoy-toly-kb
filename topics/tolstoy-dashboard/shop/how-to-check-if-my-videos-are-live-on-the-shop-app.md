## How to check if my videos are live on the Shop app?

If you’re a Shopify customer and Shop eligible, click the “Shop” tab in the Tolstoy Dashboard > Start Creating > Tag videos with products > then just Publish both Shop Homepage/Brand page and Shop product page in Shop tab.

After you publish, go to the Shop mobile app and search for your store, videos on the Homepage should automatically show as well as on product pages that have videos tagged.
