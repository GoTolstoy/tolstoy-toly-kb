## Bulk Video Publishing
To efficiently manage video content across multiple product pages, especially when dealing with a large inventory, you can utilize the 'Allow non-tagged videos on PDPs' feature. This feature enables you to apply videos to product pages without the need for individual tagging, simplifying the process for large-scale operations.

### Steps to Enable Bulk Publishing:
1. Navigate to your Tolstoy dashboard.
2. Go to the Shop tab.
3. In the settings, find and turn on 'Allow non-tagged videos on PDPs'.
4. Apply this setting to automatically sync videos across all product pages without individual tags.

This feature is particularly useful for stores with extensive product lines, allowing for a more streamlined video integration process.
