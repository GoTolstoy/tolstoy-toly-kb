## Why is Shop button not working?

The SHOP button will only appear on the Tolstoy dashboard if you're eligible and integrated with Shopify. To integrate with Shopify, please click your profile letter on the lower left -> Integrations -> Connect Shopify. Once done, the SHOP section/button should appear on the left panel of your Tolstoy dashboard.
