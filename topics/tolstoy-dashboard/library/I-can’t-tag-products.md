## I can’t tag products

Few things to consider:

1. If the platform you integrated with Tolstoy is Shopify, you can tag products by going to the “Library” tab > click the “Products” button for the video that you want to tag (your products from Shopify will automatically be fetched).

2. If you’re a native site or any other eCommerce platform like bigcommerce, Woocommerce, Wix etc. you need to upload a CSV first that contains your products to Tolstoy app so you can tag videos with products. If you don’t upload a CSV with your products, you can’t tag products because you will not be able to see the “Products” button.
