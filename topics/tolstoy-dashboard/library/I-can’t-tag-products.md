# Managing Product Cards in Tolstoy

When using product cards in your videos, you have several options to customize their appearance and functionality:

## Tagging Products
- Ensure you are on a Pro plan and using a compatible platform like Shopify to tag products in your videos.
- Tagged products will appear as clickable cards.

## Customizing Product Card Settings
- Go to your profile settings under the 'Branding' section.
- Toggle the 'Move to pdp on product click' to make the product card direct viewers straight to the product page when clicked.

## Disabling Shoppable Features
- If you wish to turn off the shoppable feature, you can do so by adjusting the settings in your profile. This will prevent product cards from being clickable and directing to the product page.

This update provides clear instructions on how to manage product cards, including how to disable the shoppable feature as per user request.
