## How do I add products in a shoppable Widget?

### For Branching Widget: 

1. Make sure your Tolstoy account is connected to your Shopify account 
2. Begin creating your Tolstoy by clicking Onsite -> Create Tolstoy -> Create from scratch -> Widget (Swipeable or Branching).
3. Choose the page where you want it to display.
4. If you choose a branching widget, you will be routed to your video files. Choose the videos you want to use in your widget.
5. Search for the products in your store you would like to add and add as many products from your store as you'd like. Once done, click Save. These are the products that will be displayed to your viewers when they interact with your Tolstoy!  

### For Swipeable Widget:

1. Go to the Design tab of the Widget that you created in the Onsite tab, go to “Feed” and make sure "Make videos shoppable" is toggled on.
2. Go to the "Videos" tab and choose your playlist/(s) and the videos will be automatically filtered. You can tag more products by selecting the video/(s) and searching for a product/(s) you want to tag.
