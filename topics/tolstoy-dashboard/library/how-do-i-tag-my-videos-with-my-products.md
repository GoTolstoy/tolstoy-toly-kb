## How do I tag my videos with my products?

1. Go to your Library section on the left panel
2.  A box will appear with the products from your e-commerce store. You can search for a specific product to tag by typing it into the search bar at the top
3. The products that match your search query will appear. Check the box to the left of the products that you want to tag in the video.

You can tag one or multiple products in each video. When you are finished tagging products for that video, click the Save button.
