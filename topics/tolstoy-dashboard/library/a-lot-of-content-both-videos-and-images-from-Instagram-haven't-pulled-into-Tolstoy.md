## Accessing Older Social Media Content
Currently, Tolstoy supports automatic synchronization of social media content from platforms like Instagram and TikTok, but only for the most recent 30 days. To access content older than 30 days, users must manually upload it to their Tolstoy account. This limitation is due to the design of the synchronization feature, which focuses on the most recent content to ensure the relevance and freshness of the media displayed.

### Suggested Workaround
- **Manual Uploads:** Users can manually upload older content to their Tolstoy account. This method allows for the inclusion of any content, regardless of its age.
- **Feature Request:** Users on the Enterprise package can discuss potential feature updates with the support team to explore possibilities for automatic retrieval of older content.

This information should be communicated clearly to users to manage expectations and provide guidance on available options.
