The Tolstoy you chose will appear in the email as a hyperlinked gif, and will be ready to send. (screenshot image: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/460894283/e93a53b6b621d51d76f2f920/image.png)

If you choose to record one on the spot - this will trigger the extension, enabling you to record your face only, your screen + face, or just screen. The Tolstoy will then be saved in your account library, and you could then share it following the steps above.
