## How can I set up a widget on a specific product page that opens up a window where customers can view video and shop products?

You can choose between Stories or Swipeable Widget. Recommended is Stories or what we call PDP Stories.

Swiepable Widget is the pop-up version on bottom right of the page while Stories are like Instagram Stories constantly showing in your PDPs.

To create Swipeable Widget > in Tolstoy Dashboard > Onsite > Create Tolstoy > Create from Scratch > Widget > Swipeable.
