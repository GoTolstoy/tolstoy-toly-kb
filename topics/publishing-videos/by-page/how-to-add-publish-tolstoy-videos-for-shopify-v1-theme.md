## How to add/publish Tolstoy/Tolstoy videos for Shopify v1 theme?

1. In your Tolstoy Dashboard to Onsite > select the Tolstoy project/video you created > click the “Publish” button on the top right > click the “Use code instead” dropdown and click “Copy code”

2. Once you copied the code, go to your Shopify admin > Online Store > Themes > click on the three dots of the theme where you want to add the Tolstoy video > click Edit code

3. You now need to find the file of the page where you want to add the Tolstoy, if you’re adding it in a product page usually the file name is product-template.liquid but if not you may need to ask a help from your dev team.

4. Once you have already found the file, you need to paste the code that you copied from Tolstoy in the code line where you want to appear the Tolstoy video and hit Save.
