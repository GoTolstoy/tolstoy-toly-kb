## I want to add Tolstoy videos to my Shopify home page.

Before you begin, make sure that you already tagged videos with products in your library. 

1. In the Onsite tab, create the Tolstoy project that you want to display in your Homepage (Stories or Carousel).
2. Tagged videos with products will automatically show in the **Videos** tab of the Tolstoy project that you created.
3. Click the **Publish** button on the upper right and copy the ID.
4. Go to your Shopify admin themes -> Customize.
5. In the homepage, add section/block and look for Tolstoy Carousel or Tolstoy Stories (select based on what you created in the Tolstoy dashboard).
6. Paste the ID that you copied and hit **Save**.

### Note: If you cannot add a block/section for Tolstoy Carousel or Tolstoy Stories in the homepage, reach out to our support team at (support@gotolstoy.com) and we'll manually add it for you.
