## I want to add Tolstoy videos to my Shopify home page.

Before you begin, make sure that you already tagged videos with products in your library. 

1. In the Onsite tab, create the Tolstoy project that you want to display in your home page (Stories or Carousel).

2. Tagged videos with products will automatically show in the **Videos** tab of the Tolstoy project that you created.
