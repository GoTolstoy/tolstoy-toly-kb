Once you have created the Carousel, you will be redirected to its own dashboard. (**Note**: If you create a layout/feature, not just Carousel but for all types of layouts/features in the Onsite tab, it's referred to as a **Project**, and each project has its own dashboard.) Here, you can manage the Videos, Design, and Analytics of the project you created.

### In a Carousel project dashboard, youâ€™ll find 3 tabs:

1. **Videos**: Manage which videos will be shown for the specific project.
