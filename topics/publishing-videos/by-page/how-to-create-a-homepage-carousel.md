## How to create a Homepage Carousel?

The Carousel feature in Tolstoy helps you create short, engaging videos that catch your customers' attention.

1. In the Tolstoy Dashboard, navigate to the Onsite tab.
2. Click "Create Tolstoy".
3. Click "Homepage spotlight".
   - ðŸ’¡Tip: The Spotlight Carousel is a newly released carousel type. You can switch it back to the default style within the design tab.
4. Click "Start creating".
5. Go to the Videos tab.
   - The condition will be 'Product tagged' by default. (Note: Videos will show here if you tag a product to a video in the Tolstoy Dashboard > Videos tab. If youâ€™re Non-Shopify, you can add a CSV file for your products and if youâ€™re a Shopify, your products are automatically synced in Tolstoy.)
