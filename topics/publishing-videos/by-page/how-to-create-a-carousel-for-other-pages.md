## How to create a carousel on other pages?

1. In the Tolstoy Dashboard, navigate to the Onsite tab.
2. Click on "Create Tolstoy".
3. Select "Create from scratch".
4. Choose where you want to display your Carousel. Options include Home pages, Product pages, Collection pages, or Other pages. Select the option that best fits your needs.

Once you have created the Carousel (for the Home page or any other pages), you will be redirected to its own dashboard. (Note: If you create a layout/feature, not just Carousel but for all types of layouts/features in the Onsite tab, it's referred to as a “Project”, and each project has its own dashboard.) Here, you can manage the Videos, Design, and Analytics of the project you created.

### In a Carousel project dashboard, you’ll find 3 tabs:

1. **Videos**: Manage which videos will be shown for the specific project.
2. **Design**: Edit the appearance of the Carousel and customize the player feed.
   - In the Design tab of the Carousel, there are 4 dropdowns:
     - **Feed**
       - Make videos shoppable: Adding products within the video, allowing viewers to directly purchase or explore the featured items while watching the video.
       - View feed in fullscreen: Allows you to view the feed in fullscreen mode, providing a better viewing experience.
       - Auto-scroll to the next video: Automatically scrolls to the next video when the current video has ended, providing a seamless viewing experience.
       - Play unviewed videos first: Plays unviewed videos first in your feed, ensuring that you never miss a new post from your favorite accounts.
       - Auto-Display Video Description: When enabled, videos sourced from social media without product tags will automatically display their original post description.

       - Carousel Type: Choose between Default or Spotlight.
       - Minimal number of videos: The widget will not appear at all unless the minimum number of videos is met (for example: If you set the minimum number to 3, and a certain product has only 2 videos, no videos will appear at all).

       - Item size: Can be Responsive or Fixed. Responsive automatically shows as many items as possible according to the carousel width. Fixed shows all the items/carousel.

       - Item height: This option appears if "Fixed" item size is chosen.
       - Horizontal spacing: Refers to the amount of empty or filled space between carousels arranged side by side.
