How to create a carousel on other pages? 

In the Tolstoy Dashboard > Go to Onsite tab
Click Create Tolstoy
Click on Create from scratch
Choose where you want to display your Carousel. You have the option to display them on Home pages, Product pages, Collection pages, or Other pages. Pick the option that best fits your needs.

Once you created the Carousel (for Home page or any other pages). You will be customized/redirected to its own dashboard (Remember: If you create a layout/feature not just Carousel but for all types of layouts/features in the Onsite tab, we call that a “Project” and each project has their own dashboard). This is where you can manage the Videos, Design and the Analytics of that project you created.

In a Carousel project dashboard, you’ll see 3 tabs. Videos, Design and Analytics

Videos - This is where you can manage what videos will show for the specific project.
