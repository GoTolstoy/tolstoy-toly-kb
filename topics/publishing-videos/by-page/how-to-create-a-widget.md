## How to create a Widget (Branching version, also used for Founder Widget/Story)?

Video branching only works on branching widgets and embedded videos. It doesn't apply to feeds like swipeable widgets, stories, carousels, hero, and TV pages.

### Creating:

1. Create your Widget.
   - In the Tolstoy Dashboard, click on Onsite -> Create Tolstoy -> Create from scratch -> Widget -> Branching.
2. Choose where you want your Widget to appear.
3. Choose the video that you want to use from the video files.
   - Options include creating an entirely new recorded video, recording your screen, uploading a video file from your computer, choosing a video from your files (this will be empty when you make your first Tolstoy!), and importing from TikTok and Instagram.
4. Add question and response options using the Custom buttons!
   - Once you are happy with the first video part, it’s time to add some text and options for the user to interact with Tolstoy using the Custom buttons. Under the Question section, type the question (if anything) you want to display. Then, add some choices for the user to select from.
   - Choose what type of response each choice should prompt.
     - Free text prompts the user to enter the text that will be sent to the Tolstoy creator.
     - Video response prompts the user to record a response video.
     - Audio response prompts the user to record an audio response.
     - Calendar allows the user to set a meeting time with the Tolstoy creator.
     - Contact form asks for some user information such as email address, name, etc.
     - Image response prompts the user to upload a file/document from their computer or mobile.
     - Promo code gives the user a promo code they get as a reward for watching Tolstoy.
   - Note: You can also use Default buttons if you're only planning to collect video, audio, or text responses from your viewers. It's important to know that the default buttons come as a set. When you choose them, all three buttons will show up together, and you can't use them separately.
5. It's time to add parts to your Tolstoy (you need more than one part to make a branching Tolstoy).
   - To add the next part of the Tolstoy, simply press Add new part. Create however many more parts you want by adding a new part, recording or choosing a video, and adding questions and choices.
6. Make branching between the different parts.
   - You need to set the links between choices and different parts. Depending on what the user chooses, they can potentially be brought to different parts of the Tolstoy. To establish the different connections, click the dropdown on the right side of each part and choose where the user should be redirected.
7. That’s it! Now, depending on which choices a user chooses, they will be sent to different parts of the Tolstoy.
