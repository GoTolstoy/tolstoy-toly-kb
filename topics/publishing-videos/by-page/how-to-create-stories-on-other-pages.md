Once you created the Stories (for Product pages or any other pages). You will be redirected to its own dashboard (Remember: If you create a layout/feature not just Stories but for all types of layouts/features in the Onsite tab, we call that a “Project” and each project has their own dashboard). This is where you can manage the Videos, Design and the Analytics of that project you created.

In a Stories project dashboard, you’ll see 3 tabs. Videos, Design and Analytics

Videos - This is where you can manage what videos will show for the specific project.
Design - This is where you can edit the looks of the Stories, and customize the player feed (screenshot of Design tab: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/916271442/d032e4fd4120f06ae2559c7e/image.png)
In the Design tab of Stories, there are 4 dropdowns:
