## I only want the widget/popup to only show in the Homepage or specific pages

You need to set up a Rules for that. In the Onsite tab > select that Widget that you want to only show in Homepage and hide on all other pages > go to the Rules tab > Add rule > select “Equals to” then paste the URL of your homepage. This applies vice versa, homepage or other specific pages.

If you want to show it on all pages, no need to set up Rules.
