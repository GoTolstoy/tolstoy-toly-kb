If you can't find the 'Tolstoy carousel' on your Shopify product page, copy the code by:

 - Clicking on the drop-down alongside "Pause" (this indicates the carousel is live) or "Publish" (make sure to click this to set the carousel live and choose Done) button in the Tolstoy app.
- Go to your Shopify theme, click on the three dots, and choose Edit code.
- ​Type product in the search field. Under Sections or Snippets, whichever is applicable, click on product-template.liquid and paste the code into your product page's template liquid in your desired position. Go to your selected page to see your carousel in action.
