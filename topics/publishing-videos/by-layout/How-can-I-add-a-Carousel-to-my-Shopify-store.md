## How can I add a Carousel to my Shopify store?

Click ‘Create Tolstoy’. 
Click ‘Create from scratch’.
Choose Carousel.
Decide where you want to put Tolstoy: Homepages, Product pages, Collection pages, or other pages.
Go to your Shopify theme and click Customize.
Before you can set this Tolstoy live, please enable the Tolstoy app on your theme -> App embeds (once per store), if you haven't done this already.
Search and click on the Home page if you want your carousel to only appear on your home page.
Search and click on Products if you want your carousel to appear only on your selected product page/(s).
Click on Default product. Your carousel will automatically appear on the PDP/(s) using "Product tagged" playlist 
Click on + Add block or + Add section.
Type "Tolstoy carousel" and click on it.
Paste the Publish ID then, click on Save.
If you can't find the 'Tolstoy carousel' on your Shopify product page, copy the code by:
 Clicking on the drop-down alongside "Pause" (this indicates the carousel is live) or "Publish" (make sure to click this to set the carousel live and choose Done) button in the Tolstoy app.
Go to your Shopify theme, click on the three dots, and choose Edit code.
​Type product in the search field. Under Sections or Snippets, whichever is applicable, click on product-template.liquid and paste the code into your product page's template liquid in your desired position. Go to your selected page to see your carousel in action.
