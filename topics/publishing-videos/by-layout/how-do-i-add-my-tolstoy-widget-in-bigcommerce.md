## How do I Add my Tolstoy Widget in BigCommerce?

Download the Tolstoy App (https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/tolstoy/?search=Tolstoy) from the BigCommerce App Store. 
After downloading the app, a Tolstoy dashboard will appear in your BigCommerce account. Choose the Tolstoy layout/feature you want to include in your site (or create a new one) and click Publish.
