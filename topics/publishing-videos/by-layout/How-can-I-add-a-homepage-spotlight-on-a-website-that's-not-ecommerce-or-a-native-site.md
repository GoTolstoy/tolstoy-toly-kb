## How can I add a homepage spotlight on a website that's not ecommerce or a native site?

Make sure first that you already added the Tolstoy Script in the <head> tag of your website.

Then in Tolstoy Dashboard > Onsite tab > click the Homepage Spotlight that you created (create if you still don’t have one) > Add videos > click “Publish” on the upper right > you’ll see the code for the Homepage Spotlight > copy that and paste it to your website’s codebase
