## How do I Remove my Widget from my Native Site (2 Ways)?

1. In Tolstoy Dashboard > Onsite > Select the widget you want to remove and click Pause. The widget will no longer be visible on your site. To display it back on your site, simply click Publish again. 
2. You can also remove the widget by deleting the code directly from your site.
