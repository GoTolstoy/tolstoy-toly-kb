## I already created Carousel. Now, I was wondering how am I supposed to bring it on the page on my Shopify website?

In the Tolstoy Dashboard > Onsite > click the carousel you created > click “Publish” button > copy the ID > go to your Shopify theme > Customize > Add section/app block > search for Tolstoy carousel > paste the ID that you copied from Tolstoy dashboard.
