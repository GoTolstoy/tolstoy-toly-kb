2. If you see that your account is already connected, but you experience issues, it might be because a different email account is linked to your Shopify store. To resolve this, follow the instructions in this [help article](https://help.gotolstoy.com/en/articles/9503843-i-m-getting-an-error-saying-that-this-tolstoy-account-is-already-associated-with-a-shopify-store?location=conversation).
   
3. Make sure you have rules for your widget
