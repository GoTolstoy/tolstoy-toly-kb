## How do I display my widget/founder video on my Shopify store?

1. First, ensure your Tolstoy account is connected to your Shopify store:

2. If you see that your account is already connected, but you experience issues, it might be because a different email account is linked to your Shopify store. To resolve this, follow the instructions in this [help article](https://help.gotolstoy.com/en/articles/9503843-i-m-getting-an-error-saying-that-this-tolstoy-account-is-already-associated-with-a-shopify-store?location=conversation).
   
3. Finally, click Publish.
