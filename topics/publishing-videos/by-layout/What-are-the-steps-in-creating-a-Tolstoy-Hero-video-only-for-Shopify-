## What are the steps in creating a Tolstoy Hero video (only for Shopify)?

**Before you begin:**

Currently, we do not support more than one hero using blocks.
If you're going to set more than one hero live on your site, you need to use the manual code instead for the second one or any further hero videos. Go to the Install tab and click </> Use code instead.

Here's how to set it up!

1. Click on Create Tolstoy.

2. Click on Create from scratch.

3. Select Hero.

4. Select the location where you would like your Hero video to be displayed.

5. Upload the desktop and mobile versions of the Hero video you want to use.

6. If you want to include a video link, simply enter the URL.

7. Click on the Install tab. On your Shopify theme, click on add section then, search for Tolstoy Hero.

8. Go to Step 3 - Complete and set live - Click on the "Complete" button then, "Publish".

9. You may click on Pause if you want to temporarily remove it.

**Note:**

The hero video won't auto-play on iPhones in Low Power Mode with battery saver on.
