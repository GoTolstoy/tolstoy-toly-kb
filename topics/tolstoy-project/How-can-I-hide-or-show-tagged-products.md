## How can I hide/show tagged products?

We've introduced a new collapsed layout for tagged products. Now, users can hide or show tagged products whenever they want. This feature helps if tagged videos overlap with captions or if customers prefer a distraction-free view. They can enjoy the video uninterrupted and check out products by clicking on tags when ready to buy.
This works for swipeable videos or feeds that aren't in full screen. Use this to improve your shoppable videos and give customers a better shopping experience.
