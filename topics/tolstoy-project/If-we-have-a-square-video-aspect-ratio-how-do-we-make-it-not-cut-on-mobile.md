# Adjusting Video Display for Mobile

When creating interactive videos, it's crucial to ensure that all elements are visible and accessible on mobile devices. Here are the steps to adjust the display settings:

1. Go to your Tolstoy Dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Onsite** and select the Tolstoy project you want to edit.
3. Click on the **Design** tab.
4. Adjust the **Item Size** option in the dropdowns to ensure all elements fit within the mobile screen.

If the **Text Size** option is not available, adjusting the overall item size can help make the content more mobile-friendly.
