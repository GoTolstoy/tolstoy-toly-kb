## Customizing the Carousel
To customize your carousel, follow these steps:
1. Identify the carousel element using your browser's Dev Tools.
2. To remove the title, ensure your CSS targets the title element within the carousel container and set its display property to 'none'.
3. To align the video to the left, apply 'text-align: left;' to the carousel container.
4. To add a border, use 'border: 2px solid #HEXCODE;' where HEXCODE is your desired color.
These steps will help you achieve the specific styling requirements for your carousel.
