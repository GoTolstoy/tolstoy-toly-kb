## How can I collect contact details from my audience?

In any Tolstoy, you can ask your viewers to identify themselves by adding a contact form that requests their name, email address, phone number, and/or any custom field! To set it up, follow these simple steps!

1. Create your contact form
   Head over to the Contact form section.

   - Collect details after responses - ask for contact details after a response. If contact details have not been collected yet.
   - Hide lead form after submission - your respondents will only be allowed to fill out the contact form once.
   - Contact details after part - place your contact form after a specific part, no matter what button the viewer clicks.
   - Name, Email, Phone - toggle on one of these fields to ask the viewers for these details as well.
   - Custom fields - enable you to add another field of your choice.
   - Select Consent if you want your viewers to approve your terms and conditions!

Note that if you're requesting for multiple items, they will be requested one after another.

Set the contact form to appear anytime someone submits a response
It would be a good idea to set the contact form to appear anytime a user submits a response in order for you to be able to respond back to them. Without contact details, they will be captured under the system as anonymous.

For that, toggle Collect details after responses.

Set the contact form to appear after a certain part
If you want your lead to appear only at a certain part, toggle on Collect details after part, and in the drop-down menu, choose when you want the lead form to appear.
