# Video Quality Recommendations for Shopify Users

When uploading videos to your Shopify platform, it is crucial to balance quality and performance. Here are some guidelines to help you choose the right settings:

- **Recommended Video Quality**: Aim for a resolution of 720p to 1080p. This ensures your videos are clear without being too heavy on loading times.
- **Aspect Ratio**: The ideal aspect ratio for videos on Shopify is 16:9 for desktop and 9:16 for mobile viewing.
- **File Size**: Keep the file size under 400 MB to avoid slow loading times.
- **Compression**: Use compression settings to reduce file size without significantly affecting video quality. Tools like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro offer easy-to-use compression features.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure your videos look great on all devices and do not affect your site's performance.
