## I don’t want to show Tolstoy video in mobile, I want it only in desktop

In the Tolstoy dashboard, when you go to Onsite and click a Tolstoy project >and click “Pause” it will automatically not show on both Mobile and Desktop. However, you can do Custom CSS code to not display the Tolstoy element container in mobile and only show in desktop. You need to be knowledgeable about HTML, CSS, and dev tools.

Inspect the Tolstoy element you want to hide on a specific screen > look for the assigned class on that Tostoy element > use the class to create a CSS code for it > and apply display: none; for a media screen you want it to hide. This applies vice versa. If you’re not knowledgeable about it, our support team can help.
