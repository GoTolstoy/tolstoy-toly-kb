## How do I enable the fast forward option in an interactive Tolstoy?

Navigate to the Tolstoy you want to enable viewing speed for. Go to the Design tab then, click Player. (screenshot images of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/890145300/fde8f63cf9a3fa8e34814137/image.png)
“Allow to change video speed” toggle should be ON.
Click “Save” when you're ready.

Note: This feature is applicable on branching widgets and embedded Tolstoys only.
