## How can I initiate the Tolstoy widget via a button click?

Opening a Tolstoy widget with a click of a button on your website can be super helpful if you prefer not to overpopulate your page. Hereâ€™s how:

You can initiate a Tolstoy widget by adding a script to the button you want to click:

window.tolstoyWidget.recreate('<TOLSTOY_PUBLISH_ID>');

To get the publish ID, go to Settings (the icon next to the Analytics button on the upper right). (screenshot image of this step: ![Settings](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/849608694/915b4e575197fa7180b5195a/042f9a7d-9dc5-47e9-a2a0-e8b10b65fb85))

Copy the Tolstoy ID. (screenshot image of this step: ![Copy ID](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/849608973/55bd83b88f3507fd9d6decb1/bbce19f1-2333-4976-bd31-74aee104e7a1))

This will be your sample script.

window.tolstoyWidget.recreate('<2a3c6hwvt9ngo>');

You are all set! You can paste the code to any button on your website where you prefer Tolstoy to appear.
