## How can I email my Quiz Results to Viewers?

Send personalized quiz results directly to your users' email using Zapier!
First, integrate Tolstoy with Zapier.
Set up your first action. The app needs to be Tolstoy, and the event is New Lead.
When you test the trigger, make sure it is from the quiz itself. It is crucial for the set up to work properly. ​(screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/545103881/711602e36569c84efe6d78ec/image.png)
The second action will be Zapier filter. The filter should be Quiz Result = Exists. ​(screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/545105856/aa40db583cf8884eb0f66692/image.png)

The email body should be like this. The To field should be sent to the Lead Email, and the body needs to contain the Quiz Result. The subject and remaining fields can be whatever you want. (screenshot image: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/545108729/fd1fd80b1f8c4a489b4e8066/image.png)
