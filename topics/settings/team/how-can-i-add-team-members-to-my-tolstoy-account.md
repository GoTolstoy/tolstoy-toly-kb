## How can I add team members to my Tolstoy account?

Click on your profile letter at the bottom left corner.
Click on Settings, then click Team and click Invite Member. 
You will see an invitation pop up - Insert the email address of the person you would like to invite, and add your message. You can also send multiple invitations by separating the email addresses with commas!
Click Send Invitation once you're done. 
Now, you'll see the invitation and its status on the page. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/422424047/b3d4f4113674aef505b6f412/image.png)

The team member will be redirected to the login screen. They need to create an account in Tolstoy or sign in using their existing account. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/450977186/e046d88fa60efd9bd1103a32/image.png)
After your team member has approved the invitation and signed up, the dashboard will look like this. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/422428666/49f2a991e78f640257138f95/image.png)
