## Is it possible to install Tolstoy on a non-Shopify store/native website?

Yes! It's possible! You need to insert the Tolstoy Script on the <head> section of your website and it should work. 
Once that is done, you can select a Tolstoy project you want to create and add to your website in the Onsite tab.
