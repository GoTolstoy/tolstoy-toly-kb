## Billing Cycle

A billing cycle is the billing period or the interval of time between billing statements that are set at one month. An example is from November 1 - 30. Should you wish to cancel your plan, it is advisable to cancel at the end of the billing period. It's because even if you cancel your plan on the second day of the billing cycle, it will still be canceled on the last day of the billing cycle. If you cancel on November 2, it will still be terminated on November 30.

Upon cancellation, your account will still have all the pro features till the end of the billing cycle. For example: for a billing cycle of November 1 - 30, if you cancel on November 2, your account will be on PRO until Dec 1.
