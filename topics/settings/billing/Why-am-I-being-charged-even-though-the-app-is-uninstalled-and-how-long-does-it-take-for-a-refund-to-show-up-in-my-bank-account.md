## Why am I being charged even though the app is uninstalled, and how long does it take for a refund to show up in my bank account?

You may be charged for the billing period before the app was uninstalled. If you believe you were charged incorrectly, you can request a refund. Refunds usually take 5-10 business days to show up in your bank account.
