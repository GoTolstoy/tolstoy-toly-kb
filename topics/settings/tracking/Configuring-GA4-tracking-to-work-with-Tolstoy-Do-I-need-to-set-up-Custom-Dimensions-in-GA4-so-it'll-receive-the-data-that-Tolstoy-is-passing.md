## Configuring GA4 tracking to work with Tolstoy. Do I need to set up Custom Dimensions in GA4 so it'll receive the data that Tolstoy is passing?

Google Analytics will work as usual and show you where your traffic is coming from. We don't modify the way it works, we just give you the ability to send extra events. If you've connected Google Analytics, you can see these events in your Google Analytics account. The events will be categorized under "Event Category" with the name of the published Tolstoy, preceded by "tolstoy-". For instance, "tolstoy-Homepage" would be an example.
