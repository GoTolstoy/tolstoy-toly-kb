## How do I hide specific variants in Tolstoy?

You can exclude variants from appearing as available variants in the Tolstoy player in just one step. For example, it might be useful, if you created a variant for a product that wasn't launched yet. 

**How to exclude variants:**

Go to Branding, under Settings, and paste the variant ID you want to exclude in the "Variants to hide" section. You can add multiple variant IDs separated by commas. That's it!
