## Is there a way to direct viewers to the product page when product is clicked?

Yes, there is. Click your profile letter on the lower left -> Settings -> Branding -> Feed cards -> toggle ON **Move to pdp on product click**.

**Note:** This feature to go directly to the product page with one click, not two, only works for videos with a single tagged product. It doesn't apply to videos with multi-tagged products.
