To change the email address associated with your account, you currently need to create a new account with your desired email and then transfer the ownership of the workspace to the new account. Here are the steps:
1. **Create a New Account**: Sign up with the new email address you want to use.
2. **Invite the New Account as a Team Member**: From your current account, invite the new account to join your workspace.
3. **Transfer Ownership**: Once the new account accepts the invitation, you can transfer the ownership of the workspace to it.

Please note, direct changing of the email linked to your account is not supported at this time.
