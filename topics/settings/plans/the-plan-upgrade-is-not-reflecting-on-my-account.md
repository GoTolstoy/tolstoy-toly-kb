## The plan upgrade is not reflecting on my account. I’m still on a free plan even upgraded.

If not reflecting and you’re the account owner, it should automatically reflect, if not try refreshing the page. If still not, I’ll connect you with our support team so that they can investigate on their end.

If you’re an admin invited by the account owner, the account owner should be the one upgrading your account. You can follow up with the account owner if they were able to upgrade your account.
