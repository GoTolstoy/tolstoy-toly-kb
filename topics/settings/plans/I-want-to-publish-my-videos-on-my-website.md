# Publishing Videos on Your Website

When you are on the Pro plan and using Shopify, you can publish your videos directly to your website without needing any third-party accounts such as Fuego. Here are the steps to publish your videos:

1. Log into your Tolstoy account.
2. Navigate to the 'Videos' section.
3. Select the video you wish to publish.
4. Choose the 'Publish' option and select your Shopify site.

If you encounter any prompts asking for third-party logins, please clear your browser cache or try using a different browser. If the issue persists, contact support directly through the 'Talk to support' button in your dashboard.
