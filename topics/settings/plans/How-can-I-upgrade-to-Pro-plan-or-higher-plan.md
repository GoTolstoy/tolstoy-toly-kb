## How can I upgrade to Pro plan or higher plan?

To upgrade, click your profile on bottom right > Settings > Plans > select the plan you want to upgrade.
If you are already upgraded but not reflecting, try to clear your cache and cookies and logout and log back in to your Tolstoy account. If still not, our support team can further check it.
