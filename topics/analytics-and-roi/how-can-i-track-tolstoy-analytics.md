# Understanding Analytics Discrepancies Between Tolstoy and GA4

When comparing analytics data between Tolstoy and Google Analytics (GA4), it's important to understand that these platforms may track and interpret user interactions differently. Here are some key points to consider:

## Tracking Differences
- **Tolstoy**: Tracks every interaction with your videos as a unique visit, potentially counting multiple interactions from the same user in a single day.
- **GA4**: Focuses on unique users per day, using a more conservative approach to count visits.

## Configuration Differences
- Ensure that the settings and filters in both Tolstoy and GA4 are aligned to accurately compare data.
