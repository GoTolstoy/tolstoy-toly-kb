# Troubleshooting Asset Rendering Issues in Shopify

When integrating Tolstoy with Shopify, you might encounter issues where assets do not render correctly, appearing black or not functional. Follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

## 1. Check File Format and Size
- Ensure that the video files are in a supported format (e.g., MP4) and within the size limits specified by Tolstoy.

## 2. Verify Video Encoding
- Re-encode the video with standard settings (H.264 codec, AAC audio) if issues persist.

## 3. Browser Compatibility
- Access your Tolstoy dashboard from a different browser or clear the cache of your current browser.

## 4. Shopify Integration
- Confirm that the Tolstoy app is properly installed on Shopify.
- Check for conflicts with other apps that might affect video rendering.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, consider contacting Tolstoy support for further assistance.
