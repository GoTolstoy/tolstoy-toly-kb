# Troubleshooting Stories Layout Issues

If you're experiencing issues with the Stories layout not displaying correctly on your website, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve common problems:

## Check Tolstoy Script Placement
- Ensure the Tolstoy script is correctly added within the `<head>` tag of your website's HTML.

## Confirm Video Creation
- Verify that the video intended for the Stories layout is created and available in the 'Onsite' tab of your Tolstoy Dashboard.

## Ensure Correct Code Placement
- Double-check that the code snippet for the Stories video is correctly pasted into the designated section of your website.

## Common Issues and Solutions
- If the video still does not display, consider clearing your browser's cache or checking for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the video from loading.
- Ensure there are no conflicts with other scripts or CSS that might affect the visibility of the Stories layout.
