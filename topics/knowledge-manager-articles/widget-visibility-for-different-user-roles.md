# Widget Visibility for Different User Roles

Understanding how widget visibility can be controlled across different user roles is crucial for managing access and functionality effectively. This article provides detailed steps on how to configure widget visibility for various user roles within the Tolstoy platform.

## Overview
Widget visibility can differ based on user roles such as Admin, Editor, and Visitor. Each role may require different levels of access and visibility to widgets on the platform.

## Configuring Widget Visibility
1. **Login to your Dashboard**: Ensure you are logged in with an administrator account to access the settings.
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Go to the 'User Roles' section under settings.
3. **Adjust Visibility Settings**: For each user role, you can specify which widgets are visible. Use the toggle switches to enable or disable widget visibility.
4. **Save Changes**: After adjusting the settings, remember to save the changes to apply them.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Widgets not appearing for a user role**: Check if the visibility settings are correctly configured for that role. Also, verify that the user is assigned the correct role.
- **Changes not taking effect**: Ensure that changes are saved properly. If issues persist, try logging out and logging back in to refresh the settings.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage widget visibility across different user roles, ensuring that each user has the appropriate access to the platform's features.
