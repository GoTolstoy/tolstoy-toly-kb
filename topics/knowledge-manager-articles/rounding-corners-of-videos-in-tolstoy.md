# Rounding Corners of Videos in Tolstoy

Currently, Tolstoy does not support the direct feature to round the corners of videos within the platform. However, you can achieve this effect by using third-party video editing software before uploading your videos to Tolstoy. Here are some recommended tools and steps to round the corners of your videos:

## Recommended Video Editing Tools
- **Adobe Premiere Pro**: Offers comprehensive video editing features including the ability to apply masks and effects to video corners.
- **Final Cut Pro**: Similar to Premiere Pro, it provides extensive editing capabilities and effects for customizing video shapes.
- **Camtasia**: A simpler tool for beginners that also includes options for video shaping and effects.

## Steps to Round Corners
1. Open your video in the chosen editing software.
2. Locate the effects or mask panel.
3. Apply a mask or effect that rounds the corners of the video frame.
4. Adjust the radius of the corners as per your preference.
5. Export the video in a supported format for Tolstoy.

By following these steps, you can customize the appearance of your videos to include rounded corners before uploading them to your Tolstoy account.
