# Troubleshooting TV Page Video Display Issues on Shopify

If you're experiencing issues with video displays on the TV page of your Shopify store, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

## 1. Check Tolstoy Script Installation
- Ensure that the Tolstoy script is correctly added to the `<head>` tag of your Shopify store's codebase.

## 2. Verify Video Creation
- Confirm that you've created the Tolstoy video you intend to display on the TV page in the ‘Onsite’ tab of the Tolstoy Dashboard.

## 3. Embedding the Video
- Make sure you've pasted the code of the Tolstoy video from the Tolstoy Dashboard to your TV page on your Shopify site.

## 4. Check App Embed Settings
- In your Shopify Theme under Customize > App embed, ensure that the Tolstoy app is toggled on.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, consider contacting Tolstoy support for further assistance.
