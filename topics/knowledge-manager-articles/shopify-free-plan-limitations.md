# Shopify Free Plan Limitations

Understanding the limitations of the Shopify Free plan is crucial for managing your online store effectively. This article outlines the key restrictions you should be aware of, particularly regarding video content.

## Video Publishing Limitations
On the Shopify Free plan, users are unable to publish videos directly on their store pages. Instead, video content can only be shared through alternative methods such as email, SMS, or the Shop app.

## Upgrade Options
To enable direct video publishing on your Shopify store, consider upgrading to the Pro plan or higher. This upgrade provides additional features including direct video integration, which can enhance your store's user experience and engagement.
