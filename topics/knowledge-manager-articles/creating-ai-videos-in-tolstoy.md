# Creating AI Videos in Tolstoy

Currently, Tolstoy does not have a feature specifically named 'Video Studio' for creating AI videos. However, users can create AI videos by integrating external tools such as Synthesia. Here's how you can integrate and use Synthesia with Tolstoy to create AI videos:

1. Obtain your API key from Synthesia by accessing the Settings in your Synthesia account.
2. In Tolstoy, navigate to 'Integrations' under your account settings and connect your Synthesia account by entering the API key.
3. Once integrated, you can access your Synthesia videos from the 'Library' in Tolstoy and use them to create interactive videos.

This integration allows you to leverage AI-generated content from Synthesia within the Tolstoy platform, enhancing your video creation capabilities.
