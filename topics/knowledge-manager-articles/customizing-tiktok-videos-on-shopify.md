# Customizing TikTok Videos on Shopify

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to customize TikTok videos on Shopify sites, including design tweaks and implementing shoppable features.

## Adding CSS for Design Tweaks
1. **Inspect the Element**: Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the video element on your website.
2. **Identify the Class**: Look for the class assigned to the video element.
3. **Write CSS**: Use the class to write custom CSS. For example, to add rounded corners, you might add `border-radius: 10px;` to the video's class.
4. **Add CSS to Your Site**: Implement this CSS in your Shopify site's theme code or through a custom CSS file.

## Implementing Shoppable Features
Ensure your videos are tagged with products. This can be managed through the Tolstoy dashboard under the Shop tab, where you can link products directly to the videos.
