# Widget Visibility Issues on Shopify Websites

If you're experiencing issues with widgets not appearing on your Shopify website, follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve the problem:

## Check Widget Address
- Ensure the widget is set to appear on the correct address. You can check this under the 'Rules' section in your Tolstoy dashboard.

## Verify Widget Code
- Confirm that the Tolstoy script is correctly pasted into the <head> section of your Shopify site. This should have been done during the installation process.

## App Embeds Settings
- On Shopify, make sure that the Tolstoy app is enabled in your Shopify theme's App Embeds section.

If you've checked all these and it's still not showing, consider revisiting the installation steps or adjusting the settings. For further assistance, contact our support team.
