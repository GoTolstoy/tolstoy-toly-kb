# Finding and Using Product ID in Tolstoy Carousel for Wix Users

This article provides detailed instructions on how to locate and use the product ID in a Tolstoy carousel, specifically tailored for Wix users.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Log into Your Wix Account:** Start by logging into your Wix dashboard.
2. **Navigate to Products:** Go to the 'Products' section where your items are listed.
3. **Select Your Product:** Click on the product you wish to feature in the Tolstoy carousel.
4. **Locate the Product ID:** In the product details page, look for a unique identifier or ID. This is your product ID.
5. **Embed the Product ID:** Replace `"PRODUCT_ID"` in the Tolstoy carousel code snippet with the actual product ID.

## Example Code
```html
<tolstoy-carousel id="o9yo52ggls306" class="tolstoy-carousel" data-product-id="your_product_id_here"></tolstoy-carousel>
```

## Common Issues and Tips
- **Product ID vs SKU:** Ensure you are using the product ID, not the SKU. The product ID is a unique identifier used by Wix, while the SKU is used for internal stock management.
- **Checking the URL:** Sometimes, the product ID can be found in the URL when editing a product.
- **API and Data Feeds:** If available, the product ID might also be accessible through Wix API or data feeds.

This guide aims to help Wix users effectively integrate and utilize the Tolstoy carousel by correctly identifying and embedding the product ID.
