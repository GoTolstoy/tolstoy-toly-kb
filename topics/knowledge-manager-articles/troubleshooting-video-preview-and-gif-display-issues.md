# Troubleshooting Video Preview and GIF Display Issues

Experiencing issues with video previews not appearing or GIFs not displaying correctly can be frustrating. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve these issues:

## Video Preview Issues
1. **Check File Integrity:** Ensure the video file isn't corrupted.
2. **Verify Encoding Settings:** Confirm the video is encoded in a supported format (e.g., H.264).
3. **Inspect Embed Code:** Make sure the video embed code is correct and fully functional.
4. **Browser Compatibility:** Test on different browsers to rule out browser-specific issues.

## GIF Display Issues
1. **Check GIF Format:** Ensure the GIF is saved in a proper format and not excessively large.
2. **Correct Embedding:** Verify that the GIF embed code is correct.
3. **Browser Cache:** Clear browser cache to see if the GIF displays correctly after a refresh.
4. **Network Issues:** Check if network restrictions are blocking GIF content.
