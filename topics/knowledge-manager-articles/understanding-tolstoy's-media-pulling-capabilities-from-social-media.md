# Understanding Tolstoy's Media Pulling Capabilities from Social Media

Tolstoy's integration with social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok primarily allows for pulling media that is directly uploaded by your account. Currently, Tolstoy does not support automatically pulling content where your accounts are tagged in. If you need to include such tagged posts in your Tolstoy projects, they must be manually added to your library.

## Key Features
- **Direct Uploads:** Automatically pull media uploaded directly by your Instagram or TikTok accounts.
- **Manual Addition Required:** For media where your account is tagged, manual addition is necessary.

This clarification helps users understand the limitations and capabilities of Tolstoy's media pulling feature, ensuring better planning and utilization of the platform for digital content strategies.
