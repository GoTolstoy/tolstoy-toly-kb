# Changing the 'Tap to Unmute' Language on Mobile Devices

Currently, the 'Tap to Unmute' message displayed on mobile devices is only available in English. This message is part of the video player interface and is not affected by the general language settings of your device or app.

## Understanding the Limitation
- The 'Tap to Unmute' message is hardcoded into the player and does not support localization at this time.

## Future Updates
- Our product team is aware of the user interest in localizing this message and is considering it for future updates. We recommend keeping your app updated to receive new features as they become available.

## Workarounds
- While there is no direct way to change the language of this specific message, users can customize other aspects of their video experience through the app settings.
