# Specifics on imageUrl in CSV Product Catalog Uploads

The `imageUrl` field in CSV uploads for product catalogs is crucial for linking product images in Tolstoy videos. This field should contain direct URLs to the images that are publicly accessible.

## Purpose
- The `imageUrl` links the product images to the items in your catalog, enhancing the visual appeal and effectiveness of shoppable videos.

## URL Requirements
- Ensure URLs are direct links to images.
- URLs must be publicly accessible.
- Use standard image formats (e.g., .jpg, .png).

## Formatting Steps
1. Ensure each URL starts with `http://` or `https://`.
2. Avoid using spaces or special characters in URLs.
3. Test URLs to confirm they display images correctly.

## Examples
- Correct: `https://example.com/images/product1.jpg`
- Incorrect: `example.com/product1` (missing protocol and not a direct link)

## Impact of Incorrect Entries
- Incorrect or inaccessible URLs can lead to missing images in your videos, affecting the user experience and potential sales.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your product images are correctly displayed in your Tolstoy videos, thereby enhancing the shopping experience for your customers.
