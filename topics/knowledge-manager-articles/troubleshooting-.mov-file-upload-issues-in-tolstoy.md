# Troubleshooting .mov File Upload Issues in Tolstoy

Experiencing issues with uploading .mov files to Tolstoy can be frustrating. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve common problems:

## 1. Check File Size
- Ensure the .mov file isn't too large. Tolstoy supports files up to a certain size limit (e.g., 100MB). Compress or split larger files before uploading.

## 2. Verify Internet Connection
- A stable and fast internet connection is crucial for uploading large files. Test your connection speed and consider uploading during off-peak hours.

## 3. Browser Compatibility
- Use a supported browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Clear your browser cache or try a different browser if issues persist.

## 4. Contact Support
- If you've tried the above steps and still face issues, contact our support team. Provide them with details about the file size, the browser used, and the error message received, if any.
