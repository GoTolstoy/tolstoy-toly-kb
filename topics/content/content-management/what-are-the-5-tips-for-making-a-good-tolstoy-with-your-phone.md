## What are the 5 tips for making a good Tolstoy with your phone?

Follow these simple tips to take your Tolstoy to the next level:


Don't neglect your background 
Your background preference may vary depending on your style of video. For instance, if you are creating a formal Tolstoy for recruiting new employees, you may want to choose an office setting by propping up some books or plants around you. However, if you are creating a more personal, vlog-style Tolstoy, you may want to hold your phone and include your face only, so that the viewers feel as if they are in a casual conversation.
 
Use basic composition rules 
Implementing basic composition rules will completely transform your video. The rule of thirds suggests that you should divide your frame into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, and that important elements should appear along these lines or their intersections. This can easily be done by turning on the grid mode of your phone before filming, and centering yourself in the correct position.

Lighting is everything 
Lighting is the most important component of video quality. In most smartphones, there is a very significant difference between day and night footage. You can make beautifully lit videos using natural light only! Sit in front of the window, make sure that there is no light behind you and that there aren't any uneven shadows. You can make natural light even more flattering by softening it under sheer curtains or gauze.
Horizontal vs. Vertical 
For most cases, it is recommended to film horizontally as our eyes are horizontally aligned. A horizontal shot will give you more room to experiment with your background, thereby allowing yourself to showcase your brand's personality and style.


However, rules are meant to be broken! Do not underestimate the advantages of a vertical video - viewers will not need to rotate their phone, and since the vertical video fills up the entire phone screen, users will pay full attention to the video.


There is no right or wrong answer, and eventually it all depends on your style of Tolstoy. If you chose a more formal, professional looking Tolstoy, a horizontal video will be the right fit for you. If you chose a more intimate, selfie-like Tolstoy, you may want to go with vertical.
Keep it steady 
You don't want your video to appear blurry, disrupted or shaky. If you are filming yourself, we recommend resting your phone against something tall and steady to support it, or even create a DIY phone tripod. If someone else is filming you, let them hold the phone with both hands and lock their elbows.
