## How can I create a Tolstoy to showcase my video testimonials?

Begin collecting video reviews using Tolstoy.
You can use testimonials you already have, and you can also download the video responses you received in Tolstoy by following the steps below!
​
All of the video responses you received will be collected in your Tolstoy Threads. Once you’re done collecting, navigate to a video response you received that you would like to include in your testimonials video. Click on the video itself.

Click Download. (screenshot image of this step: https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/768597208/a6ad2c5f0824379d2e77b4bd/image.png) 
​The video will now be downloaded to your computer. Do this for all of the responses you would like to include!
Create a new Tolstoy. 
For each part, upload the responses you would like to share (either from Tolstoy or pre-existing). You can create a linear flow where the testimonials will be shown one by one, or create a branching Tolstoy... The possibilities are endless.
