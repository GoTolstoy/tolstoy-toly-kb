What are Copyrights and Video Usage Guidelines?

We'll clarify what types of videos can be used and what should be avoided.
Instagram (Meta):
By default, Tolstoy's Instagram integration only imports videos with music rights. Ensuring rightful usage of the content and allowing the publishing of any video as is.
Alternatively, if you manually upload videos from Instagram, we recommend only publishing content that you have the right to use.
TikTok, manually uploading, and everything else:
We recommend only publishing content that you have the right to use.
TikTok does not share information about music rights. Whether manually uploading or using Tolstoy's TikTok integration to automatically pull videos, we recommend only publishing content you have the right to use.
By default, YouTube content is free to use unless stated otherwise.
