## Could you help me customize my video?

There are few design tweaks available in the Tolstoy Dashboard. When you go to Onsite > select the Tolstoy project you want to customize > go to Design tab > all available customizations are there.

But if you want some advanced customization like CSS. You need to be familiar with HTML, CSS and Dev tools (for inspector). You need to inspect a Tolstoy element in your website > look for the class assigned to the Tolstoy element > use that class to create a CSS code and add it to the code base of your website. If youâ€™re not familiar, better check with your dev team or have our support team help you with it.
