## Why is the 'Add to Cart' Button Not Working?

The 'Add to Cart' button isn't functioning properly because it requires specific integration that isn't automatically provided for non-Shopify platforms. In other words, if your online store doesn't run on Shopify, the default 'Add to Cart' functionality won't work out-of-the-box.

To enable it, use the JavaScript SDK from Tolstoy (https://developers.gotolstoy.com/javascript-sdk/subscriptions#add-to-cart), available with implementation instructions.
