## Product Overview

UGC Search allows you to search for user-generated content on Instagram that you're tagged in or that uses specific hashtags. Users will be able to see the content and browse which content they would like to use on their channels through Tolstoy. From there, they can either add it directly to the library (if they already have usage rights) or request usage rights from the creator, monitored automatically through the platform.

## User Flow

Navigate to the UGC Search by going to Library → UGC. Users who haven’t yet granted permissions for UGC search will be asked to grant permission.

### Searching for UGC:

1. Once your Instagram account is connected, you can either view content that you're tagged in or search for specific hashtags. Your own tagged content will automatically appear in the search (under @brand_handle) and you can search for hashtags in the Search bar. Please note, you are limited to 30 unique hashtag searches in a 7-day period.
2. The content will include likes and comments count, and you can select a post to watch the video and to access the content.

### Access content:

Once you have selected a post, you can access the content in two ways.

**Adding Content directly to Your Library:**

1. If you already have usage rights for a post, click "Add to Library."
2. The post will be added to your main library, and you can use it across channels.

**Requesting Usage Rights:**

1. If you don't have usage rights for a post, you will go through the flow of requesting usage rights.
2. A pre-written message requesting usage rights will appear. Customize the message to include specific details about how and where you plan to use the content. Tolstoy will include a prompt to tag the brand and use a specific permissions hashtag. Make sure to include that in your comment so that Tolstoy can effectively monitor the post for the creator’s approval. 
3. Once you click "Copy & go to post" the original post will open in a new tab. Paste the message from Tolstoy as a comment on the post.
4. The post will be moved to the Pending page in Tolstoy and will be monitored daily for approval. You can also hit the refresh button to check if permissions have been given.

**Monitoring Usage Rights:**

1. Our app will monitor the Instagram post for the creator's response.
2. Once the creator grants permission by tagging your brand and using the permission hashtag, the post will be moved to the Approved page.
3. The approved post will be added to your main library, and you can use it across channels.
