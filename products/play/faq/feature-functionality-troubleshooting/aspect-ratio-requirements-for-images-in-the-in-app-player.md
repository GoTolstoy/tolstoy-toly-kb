# Aspect Ratio Requirements for Images in the In-App Player

When using the in-app player, it is important to adhere to the specific aspect ratio requirements to ensure optimal display of your content. The in-app player shows content in a **9:16 aspect ratio**. This means that the height of the image should be 16 units for every 9 units of width.

If your images do not match this 9:16 aspect ratio, **letterboxes** will appear on the top and bottom of the image. Letterboxes are the black bars that fill the space to maintain the aspect ratio, which can detract from the visual appeal of your content.

To avoid letterboxes and ensure your images are displayed correctly, make sure to resize or crop your images to fit the 9:16 aspect ratio before uploading them to the in-app player.
