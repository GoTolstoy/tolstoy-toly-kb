## Why Carousel and Stories Disappear After Modifying Website Design

It could be related to the **Minimum number of videos** feature. Please ensure that it's always set to **1** to be on the safe side.

The widget will not appear at all unless the minimum number of videos is met. For example, if you set the minimum number to 3 and a certain product has only 2 videos, no videos will appear at all.

You can modify this feature:

1. Go to your project.
2. Click the **Design tab**.
3. Under the **Widget**, look for the **Layout** section.
4. Set the **Minimum number of videos** to **1**.
