## How do we unselect videos to hide them from product pages, so that only 2-4 videos show per product?

In Tolstoy Dashboard > Library tab > Remove the product tag on the video you donâ€™t want to show > Once you have finished untagging videos, go back to the Tolstoy project on the Onsite section. This will automatically update your feed with the recently added or removed videos. Make sure that the Playlist is set to "Product tagged" only.

You can also directly hide the videos from the "Videos" tab of the Tolstoy project. There is a hide button on the upper right hand corner of the video you want to hide. Once done, click Save. If you change your mind and want to unhide the video, click "Show".
