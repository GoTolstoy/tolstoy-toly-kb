# Troubleshooting Incorrect Video or Video Order

## Steps to Troubleshoot

1. **Verify Pinning Configuration**  
   Check if the videos have been pinned correctly in the app. Ensure the intended videos are pinned and in the desired order.

2. **Check Project Type and Target Page Alignment**  
   Ensure the project type matches the page where it is implemented:
   - **Homepage Project on a Homepage**: All videos should appear, and the pinning order should be respected.
   - **Project on a PDP**: Only product-specific videos should appear in the pinned order.

3. **Check the "Allow Non-tagged Videos on PDPs" Setting**  
   For PDP Projects:
   - **Toggled Off (Default)**: Only product-specific videos will appear, following the pinned order.
   - **Toggled On**: All videos, regardless of tags, will appear, and pinning may not behave as expected.  
   For Homepage Projects, pinning should work as expected regardless of this setting.

4. **Widget Refresh or Update**  
   If you’ve recently updated pinned videos, try refreshing the widget to see if the changes are reflected on the site.

## Common Causes

- **Pinning Not Reflected**: Misconfigured or incomplete pinning in the app can cause videos to appear out of order or not respect pinning at all.
- **Mismatched Project Type and Target Page**: A PDP project on a Homepage or vice versa can cause videos to display incorrectly or ignore the pinned order.
- **Allow Non-tagged Videos Setting**: If toggled on, this can cause additional, unpinned videos to appear and disrupt the order.

If the issue persists after following these troubleshooting steps, review your app’s video settings or contact support to investigate further.
