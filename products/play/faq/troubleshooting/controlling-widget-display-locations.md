## Controlling Widget Display Locations

To control where your widget will appear, you need to set up your rules.

### Steps

### Setting Up Your Rules

- **Any value**: This means ""Set to all pages."" The widget will appear on all URLs of the site, except for URLs you specifically exclude in other rules. If your widget is set to live without any rules at all, it will also be set to all pages.
- **Equals to**: The widget will appear on that exact URL, no digit more or less.
- **Not equals to**: The widget will be excluded from that exact URL.
- **Starts with**: The widget will appear at any URL that begins with the inserted value, regardless of what comes after.
- **Ends with**: The widget will appear at any URL that ends with the inserted value, regardless of what came before.
- **Contains**: The widget will appear on any URL that includes the inserted value.
- **Does not contain**: The widget will not appear on any URL that includes the inserted value.
- **In**: This can be used when you want to include multiple ""Equals to"" rules on the same widget. It can be a list separated by a comma.
- **Not in**: This can be used when you want to include multiple ""Not equals to"" rules on the same widget. It can be a list separated by a comma.

#### Example

Let's say that I have a clothing store, and I made a widget that I want to add to my homepage, to the entire shirts category, and to any product that contains the word ""pink.""
