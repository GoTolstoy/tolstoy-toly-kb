## Moving a Carousel from Development to Live Shopify Store

If your development/sandbox or staging environment is just a copy of your live theme, you can simply publish your staging environment. However, if you have a separate store for staging, here's what you can do:

1. Log into your live Shopify store where you want to add the carousel.

2. Create a new carousel in the Tolstoy dashboard, similar to how you did for your development store.

3. Tag videos with products if needed, then publish the carousel. Copy the Publish ID from the Tolstoy dashboard.

4. Go to your live Shopify store's theme, click Customize, and add a section or app block for the Tolstoy carousel.

5. Paste the Publish ID you copied from the Tolstoy dashboard.

This process ensures your carousel appears on your live Shopify store.
