# Troubleshooting Interactive Widgets (Branching and Swipeable) and Founder Videos for Shopify Users

This guide will help Shopify users troubleshoot issues with interactive widgets, specifically founder videos, to ensure they are published and visible on their store.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Ensure that your widgets are published and visible on your store.**
   - Go to the project you want to publish and make sure you click the publish button. When you click it, it will change to a pause button, indicating that your widget should now be live on your website.

2. **Verify that your account integration with your Shopify store is correct.**
   - Go to the integration page and ensure your store is connected.

3. **Complete the installation steps.**
   - Go to your account and navigate to Settings. Click the Installation tab and make sure you have clicked the complete button.

4. **Check your project to ensure that rules have been implemented.**
   - The page rules show where your widget will appear on your site. The conditions are based on specific URLs or keywords. Users typically use "equals to" or "contains" to determine exactly where the widget will appear on your site.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Widgets must be published and visible on the Shopify store.
- Account integration must be correct and connected to the Shopify store.
- Installation steps must be complete.
- Rules must be implemented in the project for the widget to display correctly on the site.
