## Syncing Newly Added Products

For Shopify, newly added products will automatically sync in the Tolstoy app as long as the product is published and active in your Shopify admin.

If you still can’t see the product when you’re tagging a video, try waiting 30 minutes to 1 hour, then refresh the Tolstoy app page. If the product is still not showing after that, try waiting 24 hours and check again. If the issue persists, it needs to be raised to our support team for further investigation.
