## Headless or Hydrogen Shopify Integration

The minimal integration includes the following steps:

1. Add the JavaScript script code to the <head> section
2. Add the Conversion Tracking code

Here's a [helpful article](https://help.gotolstoy.com/en/articles/8094271-tolstoy-integration-for-native-site) to guide you through the steps. This also works for Headless or Hydrogen Shopify.

Once done, you can create a Tolstoy project based on your preference in the Tolstoy Dashboard -> Onsite tab.

When it comes to installing the Tolstoy project that you created, you need to use the code for that Tolstoy project (click the **Publish** button on the upper right, Copy code) and paste it to the backend of your website where you want the Tolstoy video to show.
