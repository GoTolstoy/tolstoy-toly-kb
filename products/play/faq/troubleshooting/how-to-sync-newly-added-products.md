## How to sync newly added products?

For Shopify, newly added products will automatically sync in the Tolstoy app as long as the product is published/active in your Shopify admin. 

If you still can’t see the product when you’re tagging a video, try waiting 30 minutes to 1 hour then refresh the Tolstoy app page, if not yet showing after that. Try waiting 24 hours again and check. If still not, it needs to be raised to our support team to further check.
