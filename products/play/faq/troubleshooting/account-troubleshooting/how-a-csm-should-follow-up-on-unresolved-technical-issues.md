## How a CSM Should Follow Up on Unresolved Technical Issues

When a Customer Success Manager (CSM) encounters unresolved technical issues, it is crucial to follow up effectively to ensure customer satisfaction and issue resolution. Here are the steps a CSM should take:

1. **Check for Communication**: Verify if the customer has received any invites or error messages related to the issue. This helps in understanding if there was any miscommunication or missed steps.

2. **Request Specific Details**: Ask the customer for specific details about the issue they are facing. This includes error messages, steps to reproduce the issue, and any other relevant information. Detailed information is essential for diagnosing and resolving the problem.

By following these steps, a CSM can provide more targeted assistance and work towards a quicker resolution of technical issues.
