# Resolving Slack Channel Access Issues Due to Account Limitations

If a customer cannot join a Slack channel due to account limitations, you can invite them as a guest. This allows them to participate without needing a paid Slack account or upgrading to Slack Connect.

## Steps to Invite a Guest

1. **Open Slack**: Log in to your Slack workspace.
2. **Navigate to the Channel**: Go to the channel where you want to invite the customer.
3. **Invite People**: Click on the channel name at the top to open the channel details. Then, click on 'Invite people'.
4. **Enter Email Address**: Enter the email address of the customer you want to invite as a guest.
5. **Select Guest Role**: Choose the appropriate guest role (Single-Channel Guest or Multi-Channel Guest) based on the level of access required.
6. **Send Invitation**: Click 'Send' to invite the customer as a guest.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the customer can join the Slack channel and participate in the conversation without encountering account limitations.
