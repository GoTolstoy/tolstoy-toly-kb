## Steps to Take When a Payment Link Does Not Go Through

If a payment link does not go through, the **Customer Success Manager (CSM)** should take the following steps:

1. **Resend the Payment Link**: The first action is to resend the payment link to the customer. This ensures that any potential issues with the initial email are addressed.

2. **Check Spam/Junk Folders**: Advise the customer to check their spam or junk email folders. Sometimes, automated emails can be mistakenly filtered out by email providers.

By following these steps, the CSM can help ensure that the customer receives the payment link and can complete their transaction successfully.
