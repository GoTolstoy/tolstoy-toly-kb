## Handling Incorrect Client Charges

If a client is charged incorrectly, the Customer Success Manager (CSM) should take immediate action to resolve the issue. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Acknowledge the Issue**: Promptly acknowledge the client's concern and reassure them that the issue will be investigated.

2. **Investigate Billing Details**: Thoroughly review the billing details to identify any discrepancies or errors.

3. **Correct Discrepancies**: Ensure that any identified discrepancies are corrected as soon as possible.

4. **Communicate Clearly**: Maintain clear and transparent communication with the client throughout the process, informing them of the steps being taken to resolve the issue.

By following these steps, the CSM can effectively address incorrect charges and maintain a positive relationship with the client.
