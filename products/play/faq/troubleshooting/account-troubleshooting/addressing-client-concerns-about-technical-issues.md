# Addressing Client Concerns About Technical Issues

## Acknowledge the Client's Concern

When a client raises a concern about technical issues, the first step a Customer Success Manager (CSM) should take is to **acknowledge the client's concern**. This shows the client that their issue is being taken seriously and that the CSM is attentive to their needs.

## Provide a Clear Plan of Action

After acknowledging the concern, the CSM should provide a **clear plan of action** to resolve the issue. This plan should outline the steps that will be taken to address the technical problem, including any timelines or milestones. Providing a clear plan helps to reassure the client that there is a structured approach to resolving their issue.

## Keep the Client Informed

Throughout the process of resolving the technical issue, it is crucial for the CSM to **keep the client informed**. Regular updates on the progress being made can help to maintain the client's trust and confidence. This communication can be done through emails, phone calls, or any other preferred method of communication.

By following these steps, a CSM can effectively address client concerns about technical issues, ensuring that the client feels heard, supported, and confident in the resolution process.
