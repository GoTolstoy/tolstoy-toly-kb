# Handling Incorrect Charges After Payment Pause Agreement

## Review Communications and Billing Details

If a client is charged despite an agreement to pause payments, the first step is to **review all communications and billing details**. This includes checking emails, messages, and any other forms of communication where the agreement was made. Look for any discrepancies or misunderstandings that might have led to the incorrect charge.

## Reimburse or Credit the Client

Once the discrepancy is identified, ensure that the client is **reimbursed or credited** for the incorrect charges. This can be done by issuing a refund to the client's payment method or by providing a credit to their account for future use.

## Communicate the Resolution Promptly

After resolving the issue, it is crucial to **communicate the resolution to the client promptly**. Inform them of the steps taken to correct the mistake and reassure them that measures are in place to prevent similar issues in the future. Clear and timely communication helps maintain trust and satisfaction.
