# Rescheduling a Meeting with a CSM

If you need to reschedule a meeting with a Customer Success Manager (CSM), it is important to communicate your availability and propose a new time for the meeting. Here are the steps you should follow:

1. **Communicate Your Availability**: Inform the CSM about your need to reschedule and provide a few alternative dates and times when you are available.

2. **Propose a New Time**: Suggest a new time for the meeting that fits within your availability. Make sure to offer multiple options to increase the chances of finding a mutually convenient time.

3. **Wait for Confirmation**: The CSM will review the proposed times and confirm if one of them works for their schedule. They may also suggest alternative times if none of your proposed options are suitable.

By following these steps, you can efficiently reschedule your meeting with a CSM and ensure that both parties are available at the new time.
