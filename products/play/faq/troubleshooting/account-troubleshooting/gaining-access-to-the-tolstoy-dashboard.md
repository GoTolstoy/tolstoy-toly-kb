# Gaining Access to the Tolstoy Dashboard

To gain access to the Tolstoy dashboard, a client needs to have a profile created by an admin user. The admin user is responsible for setting up the profile with the appropriate role that grants the necessary permissions.

Once the profile is created, the client can log in to the Tolstoy dashboard. Through the dashboard, the client can manage various aspects of their account, including event settings and integrations. This allows the client to customize their experience and ensure that their account is configured to meet their specific needs.
