## Handling Inactive Payment Links for Clients

If a client hasn't activated their payment link, it is important to take prompt action to ensure the payment process is completed smoothly. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Send a New Payment Link**: Generate and send a new payment link to the client.
2. **Specify Validity Period**: Clearly mention the validity period of the new payment link in the communication.
3. **Inform the Client**: Notify the client about the new payment link and emphasize the importance of activating it within the specified timeframe.

By following these steps, you can help ensure that clients complete their payments in a timely manner, avoiding any potential disruptions or delays in service.
