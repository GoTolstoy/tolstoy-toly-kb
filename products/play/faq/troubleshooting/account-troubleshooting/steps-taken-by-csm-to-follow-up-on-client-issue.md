## Steps Taken by CSM to Follow Up on Client Issue

The Customer Success Manager (CSM) took several steps to follow up on the client's issue. These steps were crucial to ensure that the necessary information and access were provided for resolving the issue effectively.

### Follow-Up Emails

The CSM sent multiple follow-up emails to the client. These emails were aimed at reminding the client to provide the attribute for the product ID, which was essential for addressing the issue.

### Access to Klaviyo Account

In addition to requesting the product ID attribute, the CSM also ensured that the client granted access to Tolstoy's developer to their Klaviyo account. This access was necessary for the developer to investigate and resolve the issue.

By taking these steps, the CSM demonstrated a proactive approach to resolving the client's issue and ensuring that all necessary information and access were obtained.
