# How a CSM Should Follow Up on a Technical Issue

When a Customer Success Manager (CSM) addresses a technical issue, it is crucial to follow up promptly to ensure the problem is fully resolved. Here are the steps a CSM should take:

## Confirm Resolution

After taking corrective action, the CSM should reach out to the client to confirm that the solution has effectively resolved the issue. This can be done through email, phone call, or any other preferred communication channel.

## Offer Further Assistance

Even if the issue appears to be resolved, the CSM should offer further assistance. This shows the client that their satisfaction is a priority and that the CSM is committed to providing ongoing support.

## Document the Follow-Up

It is important to document the follow-up process. This includes noting the client's feedback and any additional actions taken. Proper documentation helps in tracking the issue and can be useful for future reference.

## Maintain Communication

Maintaining open lines of communication with the client is essential. The CSM should encourage the client to reach out if they encounter any further issues or have additional questions.

By following these steps, a CSM can ensure that technical issues are resolved effectively and that clients feel supported throughout the process.
