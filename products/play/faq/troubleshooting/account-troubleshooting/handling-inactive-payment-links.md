## Handling Inactive Payment Links

If a client has not activated their payment link, it is important to take prompt action to ensure the payment process is completed. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Send a Follow-Up Email**: Reach out to the client with a follow-up email. This email should include a new payment link to make it easy for the client to complete the payment.

2. **Include a Clear Deadline**: In the follow-up email, specify a clear deadline for the activation of the payment link. This helps create a sense of urgency and ensures the client understands the importance of timely payment.

3. **Clarify Pricing and Terms**: Make sure the client is fully aware of the pricing and any relevant terms associated with the payment. This can help avoid any confusion or delays in the payment process.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage inactive payment links and ensure a smooth billing process.
