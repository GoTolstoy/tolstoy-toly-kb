# Ensuring Client Issues Are Resolved

## Follow-Up Process

The Customer Success Manager (CSM) plays a crucial role in ensuring that all client issues are resolved effectively. The CSM follows a structured follow-up process to address and resolve any concerns raised by the client.

### Client Feedback

The first step in the follow-up process is to gather and review the client's feedback. This feedback is essential for understanding the specific issues and areas that need improvement. The CSM carefully listens to the client's concerns and takes detailed notes to ensure nothing is overlooked.

### Product Card Placement Adjustments

Based on the client's feedback, the CSM makes necessary adjustments to the product card placement. This step is crucial for optimizing the client's product display and ensuring it meets their expectations. The adjustments are made with precision to enhance the overall user experience.

### Integration of Yotpo Reviews

To further address the client's concerns, the CSM integrates Yotpo reviews into the client's platform. Yotpo reviews provide valuable social proof and can significantly impact the client's sales. By incorporating these reviews, the CSM ensures that the client's platform is more trustworthy and appealing to potential customers.

### Final Review Before Sale Launch

Before the client's sale launch, the CSM conducts a final review to ensure all issues have been resolved. This review includes checking the product card placement and verifying the integration of Yotpo reviews. The CSM ensures that everything is in place and functioning correctly, providing the client with confidence for their upcoming sale.

## Conclusion

The CSM's follow-up process is thorough and detail-oriented, ensuring that all client issues are resolved before the sale launch. By gathering feedback, making necessary adjustments, and integrating valuable reviews, the CSM plays a vital role in the client's success.
