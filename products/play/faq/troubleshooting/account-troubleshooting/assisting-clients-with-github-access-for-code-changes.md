# Assisting Clients with Github Access for Code Changes

## Introduction

In the realm of account management, a Customer Success Manager (CSM) often needs to assist clients with various technical tasks, including code changes on Github. This article outlines the steps a CSM can take to help a client with Github access for code changes.

## Providing Github Username

The first step for a CSM to assist a client with Github access is to provide their Github username to the client. This allows the client to add the CSM as a collaborator on the relevant repository.

## Adding as a Collaborator

Once the client has the CSM's Github username, they can add the CSM as a collaborator on the repository where the code changes are needed. This grants the CSM the necessary permissions to make changes.

## Creating Pull Requests

After being added as a collaborator, the CSM can create pull requests for the necessary code changes. Pull requests are a way to propose changes to the codebase, which the client can then review and merge.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, a CSM can effectively assist a client with Github access for code changes, ensuring smooth collaboration and efficient code management.
