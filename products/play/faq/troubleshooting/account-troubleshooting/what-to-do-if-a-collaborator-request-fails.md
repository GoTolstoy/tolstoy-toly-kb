# What to Do If a Collaborator Request Fails

If a collaborator request fails, there are several steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. **Resend the Invite**: Sometimes, the initial request may not go through due to temporary issues. Try resending the invite to the collaborator.

2. **Verify Email and Collaborator Code**: Ensure that you are using the correct email address and collaborator code. A small typo can cause the request to fail.

3. **Check for System Errors**: Look for any system errors or notifications that might indicate why the request failed. This can provide clues on how to resolve the issue.

4. **Contact Support**: If the issue persists after trying the above steps, contact support for further assistance. They can help diagnose and fix the problem.
