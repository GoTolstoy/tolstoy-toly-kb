# Resolving Discrepancies in Video and Product Visibility Across Accounts

## Understanding the Issue

When different accounts see different sets of videos and products, it can be a sign of underlying issues related to account permissions or synchronization problems. This discrepancy can hinder the user experience and cause confusion among team members.

## Steps to Resolve the Issue

### 1. Check Account Settings

First, review the account settings for each user. Ensure that all accounts have the necessary permissions to access the videos and products. Permissions can often be the root cause of visibility issues.
