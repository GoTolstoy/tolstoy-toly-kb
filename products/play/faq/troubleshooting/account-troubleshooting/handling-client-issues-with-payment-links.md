# Handling Client Issues with Payment Links

## Initial Steps

If a client reports issues with a payment link, the first step is to ask the client to check their spam or junk folder. Sometimes, emails containing payment links can be mistakenly filtered into these folders by email providers.

## Coordinating with Internal Team

If the client still cannot find the payment link after checking their spam/junk folder, the Customer Success Manager (CSM) should coordinate with the internal team. The internal team will need to generate a new payment link.

## Resending the Payment Link

Once the new payment link is generated, the CSM should resend it to the client. Ensure that the client confirms receipt of the new link and is able to access it without any issues.
