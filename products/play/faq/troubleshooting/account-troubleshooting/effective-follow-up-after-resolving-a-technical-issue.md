## Effective Follow-Up After Resolving a Technical Issue

After resolving a technical issue, a Customer Success Manager (CSM) should take proactive steps to ensure customer satisfaction and gather valuable feedback. One effective approach is to provide a preview link for the customer to review the resolved issue. This allows the customer to verify that the solution meets their expectations and functions correctly.

Additionally, the CSM should request feedback from the customer regarding any design tweaks or customizations they might need before making the solution live. This step not only ensures that the final implementation aligns with the customer's needs but also demonstrates a commitment to delivering a tailored and satisfactory experience.

By following up in this manner, CSMs can build stronger relationships with customers, address any remaining concerns promptly, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
