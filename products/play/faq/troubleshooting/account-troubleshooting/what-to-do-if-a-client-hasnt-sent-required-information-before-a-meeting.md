# What to Do if a Client Hasn't Sent Required Information Before a Meeting

In the role of a Customer Success Manager (CSM), it is crucial to ensure that all necessary information is gathered before a client meeting. This helps in making the meeting productive and efficient. However, there are times when a client may not send the required information on time. Hereâ€™s what a CSM should do in such situations:

## Send a Friendly Reminder

The first step is to send a friendly reminder to the client. This reminder should be polite and professional, emphasizing the importance of the information for the upcoming meeting. Here is a sample template you can use:

```
Hi [Client's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to remind you about the information we need for our upcoming meeting scheduled on [Date]. Having this information will help us make the most out of our time together.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any assistance in gathering the required details.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

## Follow Up with a Call

If the client does not respond to the email reminder, the next step is to follow up with a phone call. This adds a personal touch and shows the client that you are committed to making the meeting successful. During the call, gently remind the client about the pending information and offer any help they might need.

## Reschedule if Necessary

If the client is unable to provide the information in time, consider rescheduling the meeting. It is better to have all the necessary details to ensure a productive discussion rather than proceeding with incomplete information. Communicate the need for rescheduling clearly and professionally.

## Document the Follow-Up

Always document your follow-up efforts. This includes saving copies of emails and making notes of phone calls. This documentation can be useful for future reference and helps in maintaining a record of your communication with the client.

By following these steps, a CSM can effectively manage situations where a client hasn't sent the required information before a meeting, ensuring that the meeting can still be productive and beneficial for both parties.
