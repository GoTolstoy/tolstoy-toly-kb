# CSM Follow-Up Process

## Introduction

In account management, effective follow-up is crucial for maintaining strong client relationships. This article outlines the process a Customer Success Manager (CSM) follows to ensure clients receive the necessary support and information.

## Follow-Up Steps

### Sharing Examples

The CSM will share relevant examples with the client on Monday. These examples are tailored to address the client's specific needs and help illustrate potential solutions or strategies.

### Continuing the Conversation

After sharing the examples, the CSM will continue the conversation with the client. This can be done in two ways:

1. **Follow-Up Call**: The CSM may schedule a follow-up call to discuss the examples in detail, answer any questions, and provide further guidance.
2. **Next Sync Meeting**: Alternatively, the CSM may choose to continue the discussion during the next scheduled sync meeting with the client. This allows for a more comprehensive review and planning session.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, the CSM ensures that the client receives timely and relevant information, fostering a productive and supportive relationship. Effective follow-up is key to successful account management and client satisfaction.
