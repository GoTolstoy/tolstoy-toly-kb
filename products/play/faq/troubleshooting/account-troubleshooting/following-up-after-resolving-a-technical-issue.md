# Following Up After Resolving a Technical Issue

## Confirm Resolution

After resolving a technical issue, it is crucial for a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to confirm with the client that the issue has indeed been resolved. This ensures that the solution provided is effective and that the client is satisfied with the outcome.

## Client Verification

The CSM should ask the client to verify on their end that the issue is no longer present. This step is important to ensure that the resolution is comprehensive and that there are no lingering problems. It also helps in building trust and confidence with the client.

## Importance of Follow-Up

Following up after resolving a technical issue demonstrates a commitment to customer satisfaction and helps in maintaining a positive relationship with the client. It shows that the CSM is proactive and cares about the client's experience.

## Steps for Effective Follow-Up

1. **Send a Confirmation Message**: Send an email or message to the client confirming that the issue has been resolved.
2. **Request Verification**: Politely ask the client to check and confirm that the issue is resolved on their end.
3. **Offer Further Assistance**: Let the client know that you are available for any further assistance if needed.
4. **Thank the Client**: Express gratitude for their patience and cooperation during the resolution process.

By following these steps, a CSM can ensure that the client feels supported and valued, leading to a stronger and more positive relationship.
