# Addressing Client Concerns About Security Issues

## Acknowledge the Client's Concerns

When a client raises concerns about security issues, the first step a Customer Success Manager (CSM) should take is to **acknowledge the client's concerns**. This shows the client that their worries are being taken seriously and that their security is a priority.

## Escalate the Issue

After acknowledging the client's concerns, the CSM should **escalate the issue to the relevant team** for further investigation. This ensures that the problem is being looked into by experts who can address the issue effectively.

## Provide Timely Updates

It's crucial to **provide timely updates** to the client about the progress of the investigation. Regular communication helps in maintaining the client's trust and reassures them that the issue is being handled with urgency.

## Reassure the Client

Throughout the process, the CSM should **reassure the client** that their security is a top priority. This can help in alleviating any anxiety the client may have and demonstrates the company's commitment to resolving the issue promptly.
