## Effective Follow-Up on Technical Issues by a CSM

When a Customer Success Manager (CSM) follows up on technical issues reported by a customer, it is crucial to ensure clear and thorough communication. Here are the key steps a CSM should take:

1. **Provide a Detailed Explanation**: Clearly explain the technical issue that was reported. This includes describing the problem, its impact, and any relevant technical details that the customer needs to understand.

2. **Outline the Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue**: Detail the actions that were taken to address the problem. This should include any troubleshooting steps, fixes applied, and any collaboration with technical support teams.

3. **Confirm Customer Satisfaction**: After explaining the resolution, confirm with the customer that the solution is satisfactory. This can be done by asking for feedback and ensuring that the customer feels confident that the issue has been fully resolved.

By following these steps, a CSM can effectively manage technical issues and maintain a positive relationship with the customer.
