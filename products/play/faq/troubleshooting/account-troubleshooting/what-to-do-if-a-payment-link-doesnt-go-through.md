# What to Do If a Payment Link Doesn't Go Through

If a payment link doesn't go through, there are a few steps a client can take to resolve the issue:

## Check Spam/Junk Folders

The first step is to check the spam or junk folders in the email account. Sometimes, emails with payment links can be mistakenly filtered into these folders, causing delays in receiving the link.

## Resend the Link

If the payment link is still not received after checking the spam/junk folders, the client should contact their Customer Success Manager (CSM). The CSM can then resend the payment link to ensure it reaches the client.

By following these steps, clients can address the issue of a payment link not going through and complete their transactions successfully.
