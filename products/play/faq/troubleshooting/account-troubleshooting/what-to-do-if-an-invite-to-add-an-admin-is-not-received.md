# What To Do If An Invite To Add An Admin Is Not Received

If an invite to add an admin is not received, there are several steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. **Resend the Invite**: The first step is to try resending the invite. Sometimes, the initial email may not go through due to various reasons.

2. **Verify the Email Address**: Ensure that the email address you are sending the invite to is correct. A simple typo can prevent the invite from being delivered.

3. **Check Spam/Junk Folders**: Ask the recipient to check their spam or junk email folders. Sometimes, automated emails can be mistakenly flagged as spam by email providers.

4. **Contact Tolstoy Support**: If the issue persists after trying the above steps, contact Tolstoy support for further assistance. They can help troubleshoot the problem and ensure the invite is successfully sent and received.
