# What to Do If Your CSM Is No Longer with Tolstoy

If your Customer Success Manager (CSM) is no longer with Tolstoy, it is important to ensure continuity and address any pending issues. Here are the steps you should follow:

1. **Get Connected with a New CSM**: Tolstoy will assign a new CSM to take over your account. This ensures that you continue to receive the support and guidance you need.

2. **Schedule a Call**: Arrange a call with your new CSM. This call is crucial for discussing any pending issues, ongoing projects, and future plans. It helps in maintaining a seamless transition and ensures that your needs are met without any disruption.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your experience with Tolstoy remains smooth and productive, even if your original CSM is no longer available.
