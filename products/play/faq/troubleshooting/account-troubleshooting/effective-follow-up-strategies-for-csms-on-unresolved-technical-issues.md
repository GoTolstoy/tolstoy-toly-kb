## Effective Follow-Up Strategies for CSMs on Unresolved Technical Issues

When dealing with unresolved technical issues, Customer Success Managers (CSMs) play a crucial role in ensuring client satisfaction and maintaining trust. Here are some effective strategies for CSMs to follow up on these issues:

### Schedule Calls for Real-Time Support

One of the most effective ways to address unresolved technical issues is by scheduling calls with the client. This allows the CSM to provide real-time support, understand the problem in detail, and offer immediate assistance.

### Offer Alternative Solutions

If the primary solution is taking longer than expected, CSMs should be proactive in offering alternative solutions. This demonstrates a commitment to resolving the issue and provides the client with options to mitigate the impact of the problem.

### Keep the Client Updated

Regular updates are essential in managing client expectations. CSMs should keep the client informed about the progress of the issue, any developments, and the expected timeline for resolution. This transparency helps in maintaining the client's trust and confidence in the service.

By implementing these strategies, CSMs can effectively manage unresolved technical issues and ensure a positive client experience.
