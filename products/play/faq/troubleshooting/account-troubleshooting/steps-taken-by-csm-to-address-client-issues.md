## Steps Taken by CSM to Address Client Issues

The Customer Success Manager (CSM) is actively addressing the client's issues by taking the following steps:

1. **Informing the Client**: The CSM has communicated to the client that the team is aware of the issues and is working on resolving them.

2. **Working on Deployments**: The team is currently focused on deploying solutions to fix the identified issues.

3. **Follow-Up**: The CSM has assured the client that they will follow up once the deployments are complete to ensure the issues have been resolved satisfactorily.

These steps demonstrate the CSM's commitment to resolving the client's issues promptly and effectively.
