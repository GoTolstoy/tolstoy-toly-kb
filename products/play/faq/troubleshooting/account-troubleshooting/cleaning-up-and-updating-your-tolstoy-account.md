# Cleaning Up and Updating Your Tolstoy Account

To maintain an organized and efficient Tolstoy account, it's important to regularly clean up and update your content. Here are the steps you can follow:

## Schedule a Meeting with Your Account Manager

The first step in cleaning up and updating your Tolstoy account is to schedule a meeting with your account manager. They can provide personalized assistance and guidance on how to best organize your videos and playlists.

## Organize Your Videos and Playlists

During your meeting, work with your account manager to review your current videos and playlists. Remove any outdated or irrelevant content. Ensure that only relevant and optimized videos are added to your playlists and PDPs (Personalized Dynamic Pages).

## Optimize Your Content

Make sure that the videos you keep are optimized for your audience. This includes having clear titles, descriptions, and tags. Optimized content will help improve engagement and make it easier for your audience to find the information they need.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Tolstoy account remains organized and up-to-date, providing the best experience for your audience.
