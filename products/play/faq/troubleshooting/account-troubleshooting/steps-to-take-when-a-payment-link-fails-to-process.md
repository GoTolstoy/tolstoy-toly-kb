## Steps to Take When a Payment Link Fails to Process

If a payment link does not process correctly, the Customer Success Manager (CSM) should take the following steps:

1. **Coordinate with the Internal Team**: The CSM should immediately reach out to the internal team responsible for payment processing.

2. **Generate a New Payment Link**: Work with the team to generate a new payment link.

3. **Ensure Prompt Delivery**: Make sure the client receives the new payment link as soon as possible to avoid any delays in the payment process.

By following these steps, the CSM can help ensure that payment issues are resolved quickly and efficiently, maintaining a positive client experience.
