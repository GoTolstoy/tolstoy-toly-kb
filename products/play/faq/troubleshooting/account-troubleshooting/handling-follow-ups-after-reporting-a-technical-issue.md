## Handling Follow-Ups After Reporting a Technical Issue

After reporting a technical issue, it is crucial to maintain clear and consistent communication with the client. **Assure the client** that the team is actively investigating the problem and will provide timely updates on the progress. This helps in managing the client's expectations and reduces any potential frustration.

Once the issue is resolved, promptly **confirm with the client** that the problem has been fixed. This not only ensures that the client is aware of the resolution but also provides an opportunity to verify that the solution is effective. Maintaining this level of communication helps in building trust and satisfaction with the client.
