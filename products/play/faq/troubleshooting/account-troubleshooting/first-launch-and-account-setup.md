# First Launch and Account Setup

## Initial Steps for Launching Tolstoy

When launching Tolstoy for the first time, follow these initial steps to ensure a smooth setup:

1. **Replace Vimeo Videos**: Begin by replacing all Vimeo videos with Tolstoy embeds. This will help you integrate Tolstoy's interactive video features seamlessly into your existing content.

2. **Set Up the Shop App**: Next, set up the Shop app within Tolstoy. This will allow you to manage and showcase your products directly through Tolstoy's platform.

3. **Connect Social Media Accounts**: Finally, connect your YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok accounts to your Tolstoy account. This integration will enable you to leverage your social media presence and enhance your interactive video content.

By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to making the most out of Tolstoy's interactive video capabilities.
