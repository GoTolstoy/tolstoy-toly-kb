# What To Do If A Client Has A Scheduling Conflict

When a client has a scheduling conflict, it is crucial for a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to handle the situation promptly and professionally. Here are the steps a CSM should take:

## Acknowledge the Conflict

The first step is to promptly acknowledge the client's scheduling conflict. This shows that you respect their time and are willing to accommodate their needs.

## Offer Alternative Times

After acknowledging the conflict, offer alternative times for the meeting. Providing a few options can make it easier for the client to find a suitable time.

## Confirm the New Meeting Time

Once the client selects a new time, confirm the new meeting time to ensure both parties are on the same page.

## Provide a Scheduling Link

To make the rescheduling process even smoother, consider providing a scheduling link. This allows the client to choose a convenient time from your available slots, reducing back-and-forth communication.

By following these steps, a CSM can effectively manage scheduling conflicts and maintain a positive relationship with the client.
