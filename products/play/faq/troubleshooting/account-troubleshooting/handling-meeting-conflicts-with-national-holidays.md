## Handling Meeting Conflicts with National Holidays

If a scheduled meeting conflicts with a national holiday, the Customer Success Manager (CSM) will propose rescheduling the meeting to a later date. Additionally, any trial periods will be extended until the meeting can take place. This ensures that all parties have the opportunity to participate fully without the disruption of a holiday.
