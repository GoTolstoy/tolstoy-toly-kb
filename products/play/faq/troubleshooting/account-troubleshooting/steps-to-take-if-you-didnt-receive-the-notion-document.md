## Steps to Take if You Didn't Receive the Notion Document

If you didn't receive the Notion document, follow these steps:

1. **Request it again from your CSM**: Contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) and ask them to resend the document.

2. **Check your spam/junk folder**: Sometimes, emails can be mistakenly filtered into your spam or junk folder. Make sure to check these folders in your email account.

By following these steps, you should be able to locate or receive the Notion document you need.
