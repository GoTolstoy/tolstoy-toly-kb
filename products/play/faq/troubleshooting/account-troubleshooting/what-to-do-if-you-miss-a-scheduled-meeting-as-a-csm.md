# What To Do If You Miss A Scheduled Meeting As A CSM

## Apologize Promptly

If you miss a scheduled meeting due to unforeseen circumstances, the first step is to **promptly apologize** for the inconvenience. Acknowledge the impact of your absence on the client and express your regret.

## Explain the Reason

After apologizing, **explain the reason** for missing the meeting. Be honest and transparent, but keep the explanation concise and professional.

## Offer Alternative Times

Next, **offer alternative times** to reschedule the meeting. Provide a few options to accommodate the client's schedule and make it easier for them to choose a suitable time.

## Suggest Another Team Member

If another team member is more suitable for the rescheduled meeting, **provide their availability and contact information**. This ensures that the client can still receive the support they need in a timely manner.

By following these steps, you can maintain a positive relationship with your client and demonstrate your commitment to their success, even in the face of unforeseen circumstances.
