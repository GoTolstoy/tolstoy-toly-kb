## Handling Client Follow-Ups for Ongoing Issues

When a client reports an ongoing issue, it is crucial to maintain regular communication to keep them informed about the progress of the resolution. Here are some key steps to handle follow-ups effectively:

1. **Regular Updates**: Provide the client with frequent updates on the status of the issue. This helps in building trust and assures the client that their concern is being actively addressed.

2. **Scheduled Calls**: Offer to schedule calls with the client to discuss any further details or clarifications needed. This personal touch can help in understanding the client's concerns better and provide a platform for more detailed discussions.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the client feels supported and informed throughout the resolution process.
