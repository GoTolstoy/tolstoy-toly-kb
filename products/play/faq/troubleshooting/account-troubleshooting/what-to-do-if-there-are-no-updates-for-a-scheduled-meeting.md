## What to Do If There Are No Updates for a Scheduled Meeting

If there are no updates or topics to discuss for a scheduled meeting, it is advisable to reach out to the client to confirm if they have any updates or if the meeting should be rescheduled or canceled. This proactive approach ensures that both parties' time is respected and that meetings remain productive and relevant. By confirming with the client, you can avoid unnecessary meetings and focus on more pressing matters.
