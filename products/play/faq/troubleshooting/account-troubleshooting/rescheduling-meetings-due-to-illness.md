# Rescheduling Meetings Due to Illness

## Informing the Client

If a CSM needs to reschedule a meeting due to illness, the first step is to promptly inform the client. This ensures that the client is aware of the situation as soon as possible and can adjust their plans accordingly.

## Apologizing for the Inconvenience

The CSM should apologize for any inconvenience caused by the need to reschedule. A sincere apology helps maintain a positive relationship with the client and shows that the CSM values their time.

## Proposing Alternative Dates

After informing the client and apologizing, the CSM should propose alternative dates for rescheduling the meeting. Providing a few options can make it easier for the client to find a suitable time, ensuring that the meeting can be rescheduled with minimal disruption.
