## Enable Tolstoy in App Embeds

- Ensure that Tolstoy is enabled in your app embeds on your Shopify site and that you have clicked save. Afterwards, make sure to click "completed" in the [Installation](https://app.gotolstoy.com/account/installation) tab of Tolstoy.

## Minimum Number of Videos

- Tolstoy allows you to adjust how many videos must be selected or tagged to display the widget on a page. For example, if you only have a single video tagged with a product, you may not want a story to appear on your page. To avoid this, you can set a minimum number of videos required to display any stories at all.

- If you are not seeing your widget displayed on your page, you may not have selected enough videos for that page. To adjust the minimum number of videos, go to the Design tab → Widget → Minimum Number of Videos, and hit save. To add more videos, you can select more playlists, add more videos to your selected playlists, or tag more videos with products.

- Please note, if you are using a Product Page widget, by default it will only add videos that are tagged with that product to a specific PDP. If you want all videos to appear on every PDP, please go to your widget’s settings (below the publish button) and select "Allow non-tagged videos on PDPs."

## Rules for Widget Tolstoy Project

- Within your Widget Tolstoy project, the "Rules" tab will dictate where your widget will or will not appear.

- You can adjust where your widget appears per store, per URL, based on event triggers, with user attributes, or based on mobile/desktop. Visit the Rules tab (this is only available for the "Widget" Tolstoy type) to explore more.
