## Incorrect videos are appearing on my pages

### I added my Tolstoy widget to my product pages, but I don’t see all the videos I selected.

If you want to see all videos within the selected playlists on your all your product pages (not just the videos with that product tagged), go to the widget’s settings (below the publish button) and select “Allow non-tagged videos on PDPs”

### I added my Tolstoy widget to my product pages, but I only want videos tagged with that product to appear.

To ensure videos are only displayed on product pages where the respective product is tagged, go to the widget’s settings (below the publish button) and deselect “Allow non-tagged videos on PDPs”
