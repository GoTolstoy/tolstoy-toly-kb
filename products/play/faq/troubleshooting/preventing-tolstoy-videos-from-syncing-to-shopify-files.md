## Preventing Tolstoy Videos from Syncing to Shopify Files

Tolstoy videos automatically sync to Shopify Files to ensure they appear on the Shop app and load faster. 

If you prefer to prevent this synchronization, please contact support to have it removed on the backend. However, be aware that this change will result in your videos not appearing on the Shop app and potentially slower video loading speeds.
