## Troubleshooting Tolstoy Account Connection to Shopify

If you have multiple Shopify accounts or stores, you might encounter an error stating that Tolstoy is already connected. This could be because Tolstoy is installed on one of your other stores.

1. First, check all of your Shopify stores and ensure that Tolstoy is uninstalled from each one.

2. Once you have uninstalled Tolstoy from all stores, go back to the Tolstoy app. Navigate to Integrations and connect the correct Shopify store or app URL.
