## Troubleshooting Instagram Reels Not Syncing

1. **Video Source:** You can only see the videos you created directly on your Instagram account in Tolstoy. Tagged videos from other accounts won't automatically show up. If you need those videos, you can manually download and upload them to your Tolstoy account. Here's a tool that might help with downloading Instagram videos: [SnapInsta](https://snapinsta.app/instagram-reels-video-download).

2. **Collaborator Posts:** Videos posted as collaborations with other accounts will only appear if the user has enabled collaborator tagging.

3. **Copyrighted Music:** Meta removes the download link if the video has copyrighted content, which removes the option to import the specific video. Videos with copyrighted music will not sync to the library.

4. **Integration Settings:** Ensure your Instagram account is properly connected in your Tolstoy integrations.

5. **Sync Issues:** Sometimes, there might be a delay in syncing the videos from Instagram to Tolstoy. You can try refreshing the integration.

6. **Permissions:** Ensure that all necessary permissions are granted to Tolstoy to access your Instagram videos.
