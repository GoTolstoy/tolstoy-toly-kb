# Increased Number of (not set) Landing Pages in GA4

## Understanding the Issue

The increased number of **(not set)** landing pages in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is a common technical issue that many users encounter. This issue arises when Tolstoy events are triggered without proper filtering or management.

## Cause of the Issue

When Tolstoy events are not correctly filtered or managed, they can interfere with the data collection process in GA4. This interference results in the appearance of **(not set)** landing pages in your analytics reports. Essentially, GA4 is unable to attribute these events to specific landing pages, leading to incomplete or inaccurate data.

## Addressing the Issue

To resolve this issue, it is crucial to implement proper filtering and management of Tolstoy events. This can involve setting up specific filters within GA4 to ensure that only relevant events are tracked and attributed correctly. Additionally, reviewing and adjusting your event management strategy can help in minimizing the occurrence of **(not set)** landing pages.

## Conclusion

The appearance of **(not set)** landing pages in GA4 can significantly impact the accuracy of your analytics data. By understanding the cause and implementing appropriate filtering and management strategies for Tolstoy events, you can mitigate this issue and ensure more accurate data collection and reporting in GA4.
