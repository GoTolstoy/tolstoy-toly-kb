## Adding Tolstoy Videos to Klaviyo Emails Based on Product Events

To show Tolstoy videos related to the product featured in the cart within Klaviyo emails, you can utilize the 'Abandonment Revival' and 'Post-Purchase Guides' use cases. These dynamic widgets generate multiple feeds based on the product triggered from an event in Klaviyo. This means you do not need to add any specific rules to your existing flows. Simply add the Tolstoy widget to a flow that is triggered by a product-related event once. Based on this event and the products tagged in the Tolstoy admin, a personalized feed will be created for each email.

If you want to show a Tolstoy video that has been tagged as the same product in a quiz result, you need to create user segments based on the quiz results. If the email template for the quiz result is a template-based product trigger event, you should add one of the 'Flows' use cases (abandonment/post-purchase). If this is not the case, further discussion with the product team will be required to implement this feature.
