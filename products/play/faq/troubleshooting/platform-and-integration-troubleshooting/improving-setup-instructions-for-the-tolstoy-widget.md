# Improving Setup Instructions for the Tolstoy Widget

## Introduction
Setting up the Tolstoy widget can be a straightforward process, but there are certain nuances that users need to be aware of to ensure a smooth experience. One critical aspect that can be improved in the setup instructions is the inclusion of a note regarding the limitations of using the Tolstoy widget in certain environments.

## Key Improvement
### Note on Environment Limitations
To enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the setup instructions, it is essential to include a note that the Tolstoy widget will not work properly in a local or development environment for Headless or non-Shopify storefronts. This information is crucial for developers and users who might be testing the widget in such environments and could face unexpected issues.

## Conclusion
By adding this note to the setup instructions, Tolstoy can help users avoid potential pitfalls and ensure a smoother setup process. This small but significant improvement can lead to better user experiences and fewer support requests related to environment-specific issues.
