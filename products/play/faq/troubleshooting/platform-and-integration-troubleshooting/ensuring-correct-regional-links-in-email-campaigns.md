# Ensuring Correct Regional Links in Email Campaigns

When running an email campaign, it's crucial to ensure that the links included navigate to the correct regional sites. This can be achieved by verifying the project settings in the off-site section for each region and updating the links accordingly. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Verify Project Settings**: Go to the project settings and check the off-site section for each region. Ensure that the settings are correctly configured for the specific regional sites.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your email campaign links navigate to the correct regional sites, providing a seamless experience for your audience.
