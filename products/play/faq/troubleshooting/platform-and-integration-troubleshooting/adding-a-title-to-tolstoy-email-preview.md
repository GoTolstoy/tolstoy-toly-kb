# Adding a Title to Tolstoy Email Preview

To ensure that your Tolstoy email preview includes a title, you need to manually add a text block above the GIF carousel. The title 'See it in action' has not been removed from the preview by default. Here are the steps to add a title:

1. **Open your Tolstoy email template**: Navigate to the email template you are working on.
2. **Add a text block**: Insert a text block at the top of the email template, above the GIF carousel.
3. **Enter your title**: Type in the desired title, such as 'See it in action'.
4. **Save your changes**: Ensure you save the template after making the changes.

By following these steps, you can customize your email preview to include a title, making it more engaging and informative for your recipients.
