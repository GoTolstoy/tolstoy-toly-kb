# Following Up on Implementation Issues

When addressing implementation issues, it's crucial to follow up effectively to ensure resolution. In this case, David took a proactive approach to follow up with Roberto regarding the ongoing implementation issues. 

## Acknowledging the Issues

David began by acknowledging the ongoing issues. This step is important as it shows that he is aware of the problems and is taking them seriously. Acknowledgment helps in building trust and shows commitment to resolving the issues.

## Proposing a Call

To address the issues more effectively, David proposed a call. This allows for real-time communication, which can be more efficient than back-and-forth emails. During the call, they can discuss the problems in detail and brainstorm potential solutions.

## Including Additional Assistance

David also suggested including Gilbert Castro (Gee) in the call. Bringing in additional assistance can provide new perspectives and expertise, which can be invaluable in resolving complex issues. Gee's involvement indicates a collaborative approach to problem-solving.

By following these steps, David demonstrated a structured and effective way to follow up on implementation issues, ensuring that all parties are aligned and working towards a resolution.
