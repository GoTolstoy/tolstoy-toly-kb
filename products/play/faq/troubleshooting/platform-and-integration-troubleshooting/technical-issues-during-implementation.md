## Technical Issues During Implementation

### Limited Access to KitchenAid Store

Roni faced a significant technical issue during the implementation phase due to **limited access to the KitchenAid store**. This restriction hindered the ability to test and implement the video components effectively. Without adequate access, it was challenging to ensure that the video components functioned correctly within the store's environment, leading to potential delays and complications in the project timeline.
