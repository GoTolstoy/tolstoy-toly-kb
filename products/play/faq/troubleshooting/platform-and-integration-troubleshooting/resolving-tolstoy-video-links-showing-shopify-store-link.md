## Resolving Tolstoy Video Links Showing Shopify Store Link

If your Tolstoy video links are displaying your Shopify store link instead of your main domain, it is typically due to the default domain settings in your Tolstoy dashboard. To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Update Domain Settings**: Go to your Tolstoy dashboard and check the domain settings. Ensure that your main domain is set as the default domain instead of your Shopify store link.

2. **Check Domain Forwarding**: If updating the domain settings does not resolve the issue, it may be related to how Shopify handles domain forwarding. Verify your domain forwarding settings in Shopify to ensure they are correctly configured.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and have your Tolstoy video links display your main domain correctly.
