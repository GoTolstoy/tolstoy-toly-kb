# Embedding Tolstoy Content into Klaviyo Emails

Embedding Tolstoy content into your Klaviyo emails is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to seamlessly integrate engaging Tolstoy content into your email campaigns:

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Navigate to the 'Offsite' Section

First, log in to your Tolstoy dashboard. From the main menu, navigate to the 'Offsite' section. This is where you can manage and create Tolstoy content for use outside of your primary Tolstoy platform.

### 2. Create a New Tolstoy

In the 'Offsite' section, create a new Tolstoy. This involves selecting the type of content you want to create and customizing it to fit your needs. You can add various interactive elements to make your Tolstoy engaging.

### 3. Tag Products

Once your Tolstoy is created, you can tag products within the content. This is particularly useful for e-commerce businesses looking to highlight specific products in their email campaigns.

### 4. Publish Your Tolstoy

After tagging products and finalizing your content, publish your Tolstoy. This will make it available for embedding and sharing.

### 5. Copy the Code from the 'Email' Tab

Once your Tolstoy is published, go to the 'Email' tab in the Tolstoy dashboard. Here, you will find the embed code specifically designed for email integration. Copy this code.

### 6. Paste the Code into Your Klaviyo Email Template

Finally, log in to your Klaviyo account and open the email template where you want to embed the Tolstoy content. Paste the copied code into the appropriate section of your email template. Save your changes, and your Tolstoy content will be embedded in your Klaviyo email.

By following these steps, you can enhance your Klaviyo email campaigns with interactive and engaging Tolstoy content, driving higher engagement and conversions.
