## Common Causes of Page Build Issues in Shopify Stores

Issues with page builds in a Shopify store can often be traced back to two primary sources: conflicts with third-party page builders and incorrect configurations within the store's code.

### Conflicts with Third-Party Page Builders

Many Shopify store owners use third-party page builders to create and customize their store's pages. While these tools can be incredibly powerful, they can also introduce conflicts, especially if multiple page builders are used simultaneously or if the page builder is not fully compatible with the store's theme or other installed apps.

### Incorrect Configurations

Another common cause of page build issues is incorrect configurations within the store's code. This can include errors in the Liquid templates, JavaScript, or CSS files that make up the store's theme. Even small mistakes in the code can lead to significant problems with how pages are built and displayed.

To resolve these issues, it is important to carefully review any recent changes to the store's code or installed apps and to test the store's functionality after each change. Additionally, seeking support from Shopify experts or the developers of third-party tools can help identify and fix the root causes of page build issues.
