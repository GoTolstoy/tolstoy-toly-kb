## Finding Developer Documentation for Non-Shopify Sites

For non-Shopify implementations, you can find the necessary code under the 'Publish' section. Look for the option that says 'use code instead'. Make sure to change the 'HEADER_ID' and place the code in the correct location on your page. This will ensure proper integration and functionality of the widget on your non-Shopify site.
