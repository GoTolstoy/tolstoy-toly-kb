# Next Steps Before Going Live with Tolstoy

Before going live with Tolstoy, there are a few crucial steps to ensure everything runs smoothly. These steps include pushing the code to a test theme, conducting a final round of testing, and then pushing the code to the master theme if all looks good.

## Push Code to a Test Theme

The first step is to push the code to a test theme. This allows you to see how the changes will look and function in an environment that closely mirrors the live site without affecting the actual live site.

## Conduct a Final Round of Testing

Once the code is on the test theme, conduct a thorough round of testing. This includes checking for any bugs, ensuring all features work as expected, and verifying that the user experience is smooth and intuitive.

## Push Code to the Master Theme

If everything looks good after testing, the final step is to push the code to the master theme. This will make the changes live for all users. It's important to double-check everything before this final push to avoid any disruptions.

By following these steps, you can ensure a smooth transition when going live with Tolstoy.
