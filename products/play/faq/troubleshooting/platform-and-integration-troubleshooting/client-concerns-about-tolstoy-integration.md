## Client Concerns About Tolstoy Integration

### Visibility of Products in Cart

One of the primary concerns expressed by Alexandre regarding the Tolstoy integration was that products added from Tolstoy were not visible in the cart. This issue can lead to confusion for customers who may think that their selected products have not been added, potentially affecting their shopping experience and satisfaction.

### Duplicate Products in Main PDP

Another concern raised was that products appeared as duplicates when added again from the main Product Detail Page (PDP). This duplication can create an inaccurate representation of the cart's contents, leading to potential issues with inventory management and customer frustration.

Addressing these concerns is crucial for ensuring a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience for customers using the Tolstoy integration.
