# Clarifying Technical Issues with Instagram Carousel Posts in Tolstoy

When dealing with technical issues related to Instagram carousel posts in Tolstoy, it is important to understand how the images are processed. The Customer Success Manager (CSM) clarified that the images from an Instagram carousel post are pulled into Tolstoy separately. This means that each image in the carousel is treated as an individual entity within the Tolstoy platform.

Understanding this process can help users troubleshoot and resolve issues more effectively. If images from a carousel post are not appearing as expected, it may be due to the way they are imported and displayed separately. Ensuring that each image is correctly uploaded and linked can help mitigate these issues.
