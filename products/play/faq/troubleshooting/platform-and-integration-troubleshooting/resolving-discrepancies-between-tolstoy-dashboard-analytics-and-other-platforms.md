## Resolving Discrepancies Between Tolstoy Dashboard Analytics and Other Platforms

When you notice discrepancies between Tolstoy dashboard analytics and another platform, it is essential to follow a systematic approach to identify and resolve the issue. Here are the steps you should take:

### Verify Event Tracking

First, ensure that both Tolstoy and the other platform are tracking the same events. This includes verifying that the same parameters and metrics are being used. Differences in event definitions or tracking methods can lead to discrepancies in the reported data.

### Check Parameters

Next, confirm that the parameters used for tracking are consistent across both platforms. Inconsistent parameters can result in mismatched data, leading to discrepancies in analytics.

### Escalate to Technical Support

If discrepancies persist after verifying event tracking and parameters, escalate the issue to the technical support team. Provide them with detailed information about the discrepancies and the steps you have already taken to resolve the issue. The technical support team will conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause and provide a solution.

By following these steps, you can effectively address and resolve discrepancies between Tolstoy dashboard analytics and other platforms.
