# Resolving Video Links Showing Shopify Store Link Instead of Main Domain

## Understanding the Issue
When video links show the Shopify store link instead of the main domain, it is typically due to the default domain settings in Tolstoy. This can cause confusion and misdirect users who expect to see the main domain.

## Cause of the Issue
The primary cause of this issue is that the default domain in the Tolstoy settings is set to the Shopify store link. This setting determines which domain is used for video links.

## Solution
To resolve this issue, you need to update the domain settings in the Tolstoy dashboard. Follow these steps:

1. **Log in to the Tolstoy dashboard**: Access your Tolstoy account and navigate to the dashboard.
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Find the settings section where domain configurations are managed.
3. **Update the Default Domain**: Change the default domain from the Shopify store link to the main domain you want to use.
4. **Save Changes**: Ensure you save the changes to update the settings.

By updating the domain settings, video links will reflect the main domain instead of the Shopify store link, resolving the issue effectively.
