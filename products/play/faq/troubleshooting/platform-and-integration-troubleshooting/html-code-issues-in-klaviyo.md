# HTML Code Issues in Klaviyo

When encountering issues with HTML code in Klaviyo, it is often related to the specific flow within Klaviyo and the source project of the videos. In particular, if the videos are part of a shop project that is not onsite and not located on the client's online store, this can cause problems.

## Understanding the Problem

### Specific Flow in Klaviyo
Klaviyo's flows are automated sequences that can be triggered by various actions or events. If there is an issue with the HTML code, it may be due to how the flow is set up or how it interacts with the content being used.

### Source Project of the Videos
If the videos are sourced from a shop project that is not onsite and not located on the client's online store, this can lead to compatibility issues. The HTML code may not render correctly if it is trying to pull content from an external source that is not properly integrated with the Klaviyo platform.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check the Flow Configuration**: Ensure that the flow in Klaviyo is set up correctly and that all triggers and actions are properly configured.
2. **Verify Video Source**: Make sure that the videos are hosted in a location that is compatible with Klaviyo and that they are properly linked within the HTML code.
3. **Test the HTML Code**: Run tests to see how the HTML code renders within Klaviyo. Look for any errors or issues that may indicate a problem with the code or its integration.
4. **Consult Klaviyo Support**: If the issue persists, reach out to Klaviyo support for assistance. They can provide guidance and help troubleshoot the problem.

By following these steps, you can identify and resolve issues with HTML code in Klaviyo, ensuring that your content displays correctly and functions as intended.
