## Troubleshooting Visibility of Connected Social Media Accounts

If you are unable to see the social media accounts that your colleague has connected, this issue typically arises due to individual user settings within the same organization. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Individual Account Connections**: Each member might need to connect their personal accounts for visibility. Ensure that all relevant accounts are connected under the organization's main account.

2. **Integration Settings**: Check the integration settings to ensure that there are no specific permissions or settings that might be restricting visibility. Permissions can often be a common cause of such issues.

3. **Refresh Integration**: Sometimes, simply refreshing the integration can help. This ensures that all data is fully synced and up-to-date.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and see the connected social media accounts of your colleagues.
