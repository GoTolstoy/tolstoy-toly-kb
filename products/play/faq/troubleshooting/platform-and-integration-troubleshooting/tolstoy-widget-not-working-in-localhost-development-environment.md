## Tolstoy Widget Not Working in Localhost Development Environment

When working with the Tolstoy widget in a localhost or development environment, you may encounter issues where the widget does not function as expected. This is a common problem that can be resolved by deploying the necessary changes to a live preview link.

### Why This Happens
The Tolstoy widget may rely on certain configurations or resources that are not fully available or properly configured in a localhost environment. This can lead to the widget not loading or functioning correctly.

### Solution
To resolve this issue, deploy your changes to a live preview link. This allows you to test the widget in an environment that more closely resembles the production setup, ensuring that all necessary resources and configurations are in place.

By following this approach, you can ensure that the Tolstoy widget works as intended and avoid the limitations of a localhost development environment.
