## Technical Issues with Tolstoy Email Integration

### Causes of Integration Failure
The failure of Tolstoy email integration in some abandonment flows can be attributed to how Klaviyo passes the variant ID to Tolstoy. If the product ID is not correctly passed, Tolstoy cannot forward users to the correct product page and play the relevant videos.

### Resolving the Product ID Issue
To resolve this issue, it is essential to identify the attribute that contains the real product ID in Klaviyo. Once identified, updating the HTML code of the email to suit this setup can ensure that the correct product ID is passed, allowing Tolstoy to function as intended.
