## How Tolstoy Handles Event Pushing and Customer Privacy

Tolstoy ensures that event pushing and customer privacy are handled with the utmost care. Here are the key points:

### Event Pushing
Tolstoy pushes events to the `dataLayer`, a common practice for managing and tracking events in web applications. This allows for seamless integration with various analytics and marketing tools.

### Customer Privacy
Tolstoy adheres strictly to Shopify customer privacy consent. This means that no events are sent if the customer has not given their consent. This ensures that customer data is protected and that Tolstoy complies with privacy regulations.

By combining these practices, Tolstoy provides a robust solution for event tracking while maintaining customer privacy.
