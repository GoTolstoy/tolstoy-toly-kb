## Technical Issues with Tolstoy App Implementation

The client encountered several challenges while implementing the Tolstoy app to match their design document. The primary issues were related to achieving the desired design and functionality across different devices.

### Design and Functionality Mismatch

The client found it difficult to align the Tolstoy app's design and functionality with their design specifications. Specifically, the developer noted that the desired desktop appearance could only be achieved using the 'default' carousel. However, for mobile functionality, the 'spotlight' carousel was required. This discrepancy made it challenging to maintain a consistent user experience across both desktop and mobile platforms.

### Positioning Limitations

Another significant issue was the limitation in controlling the positioning of the videos. The client faced constraints in adjusting the video placement to fit their design requirements, which further complicated the implementation process.

These technical issues highlight the need for more flexible design and functionality options within the Tolstoy app to better accommodate diverse client requirements.
