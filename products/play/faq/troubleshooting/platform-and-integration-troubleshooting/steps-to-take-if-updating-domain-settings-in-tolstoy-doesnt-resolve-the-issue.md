## Steps to Take if Updating Domain Settings in Tolstoy Doesn't Resolve the Issue

If updating the domain settings in Tolstoy doesn't resolve the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Clear Your Browser's Cache**: Sometimes, old data stored in your browser can cause issues. Clearing the cache can help ensure that you're seeing the most up-to-date information.

2. **Check Again**: After clearing the cache, revisit the domain settings to see if the issue has been resolved.

3. **Consider Shopify's Default URL Forwarding**: If the problem persists, it might be due to Shopify's default URL forwarding settings. This can sometimes interfere with custom domain settings.

4. **Contact Tolstoy Support**: If none of the above steps work, reach out to Tolstoy support for further assistance. They can provide more specific guidance and help troubleshoot the issue further.
