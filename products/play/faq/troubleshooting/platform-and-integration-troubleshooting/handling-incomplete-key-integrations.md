## Handling Incomplete Key Integrations

If a key integration, such as YouTube, is not yet completed, it is important to **communicate this to the client** and provide an **updated timeline** for when the integration will be completed. Clear communication helps manage client expectations and maintains trust. Ensure that the client is kept informed of any progress or changes to the timeline to avoid misunderstandings and to demonstrate commitment to resolving the issue.
