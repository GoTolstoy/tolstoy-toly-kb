## Technical Issues with Relative Links and GA4 Events

### Relative Links on the Professional Site

The relative links on the professional site were not working as intended. The professional site is under the '/hcp/' sub-directory, and the current logic of the relative link was maintaining the subpage and appending the relative link from the button to the end.

### GA4 Events Not Showing on Reporting

The GA4 events were not showing on the reporting dashboard. The CSM requested access to the client's GA4 account to investigate and create standard reporting.
