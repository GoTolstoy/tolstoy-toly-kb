## Gaining Access to a Client's Shopify Store for Troubleshooting

When a Customer Success Manager (CSM) needs to troubleshoot issues on a client's Shopify store, they can request collaborator access. This process involves the following steps:

1. **Request Access**: The CSM sends a request for collaborator access to the client's Shopify store.
2. **Client Approval**: The client receives the request and needs to approve it.
3. **Access Granted**: Once the client approves the request, the CSM gains access to the store and can begin troubleshooting.

This method ensures that the CSM can assist with resolving issues while maintaining the security and integrity of the client's store.
