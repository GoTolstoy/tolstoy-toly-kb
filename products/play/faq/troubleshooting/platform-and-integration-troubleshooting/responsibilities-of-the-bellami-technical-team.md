## Responsibilities of the Bellami Technical Team

The Bellami technical team has several key responsibilities to ensure the smooth integration and functionality of their systems. These responsibilities include:

1. **Integrating the Production Account**: The team is responsible for integrating the newly created production account to the production site. This ensures that the production environment is properly set up and ready for use.

2. **Connecting to the Development Site**: In addition to integrating the production account, the team must also connect it to the development site. This connection is crucial for testing and development purposes, ensuring that any changes or updates can be tested before being deployed to the production environment.

3. **Managing the Tolstoy Module**: The Bellami technical team must ensure that the Tolstoy module is not added to the theme. This is important to prevent the module from showing up on the front-end, which could affect the user experience or site functionality.

By fulfilling these responsibilities, the Bellami technical team plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and performance of their production and development environments.
