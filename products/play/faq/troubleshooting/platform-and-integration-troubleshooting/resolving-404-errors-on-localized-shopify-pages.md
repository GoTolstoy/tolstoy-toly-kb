# Resolving 404 Errors on Localized Shopify Pages

Encountering a 404 error on a localized version of your Shopify page can be frustrating. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

## Check URL Paths

Ensure that the URL paths are correctly set up in your Shopify settings for different regions. Incorrect URL paths can lead to 404 errors, so double-check that each localized version has the correct path.

## Verify Page Existence

Check if the linked page exists and is published for the specific locale. Sometimes, the page might not be published or could have been deleted, leading to a 404 error.

By following these steps, you can resolve 404 errors on localized Shopify pages and ensure a smooth user experience for your customers.
