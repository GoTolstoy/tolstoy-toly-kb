# Resolving Tolstoy Integration Issues with Abandoned Cart Flows

## Overview
Sydney reported a technical issue with the Tolstoy integration. The problem involves the abandoned cart flows not displaying the integration properly. Instead of directing users to the product page when they click on the videos, the system reverts to the TV page.

## Issue Description
When users interact with the abandoned cart flows, they expect to be redirected to the specific product page related to the video they clicked on. However, due to the reported issue, the system is incorrectly redirecting them to the TV page. This misdirection can lead to confusion and a poor user experience, potentially affecting conversion rates.

## Potential Impact
- **User Confusion:** Users may become confused when they are not taken to the expected product page.
- **Reduced Conversions:** The incorrect redirection can lead to a drop in conversions as users may abandon their purchase if they cannot easily find the product they were interested in.
- **Customer Frustration:** Repeated issues with navigation can frustrate customers, leading to negative perceptions of the service.

## Steps to Resolve
1. **Identify the Root Cause:** Investigate the integration settings to determine why the redirection is defaulting to the TV page.
2. **Check URL Configurations:** Ensure that the URLs associated with the videos in the abandoned cart flows are correctly configured to point to the respective product pages.
3. **Update Integration Settings:** Make necessary adjustments to the Tolstoy integration settings to correct the redirection paths.
4. **Test the Flows:** After making changes, thoroughly test the abandoned cart flows to confirm that users are redirected to the correct product pages.
5. **Monitor Performance:** Keep an eye on the performance of the abandoned cart flows post-fix to ensure the issue does not recur.

## Conclusion
Addressing the issue with the Tolstoy integration in abandoned cart flows is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience and optimizing conversion rates. By following the outlined steps, the problem can be resolved effectively, ensuring that users are directed to the correct product pages when interacting with the videos.
