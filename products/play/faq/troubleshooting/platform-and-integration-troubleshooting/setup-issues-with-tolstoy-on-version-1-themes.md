# Setup Issues with Tolstoy on Version 1 Themes

## Understanding the Problem

When setting up Tolstoy on version 1 themes, users may encounter technical issues. These setup issues primarily occur because version 1 themes do not allow blocks to be set up on a non-homepage template.

## Why This Happens

Version 1 themes are designed with certain limitations, one of which is the restriction on placing blocks on templates other than the homepage. This limitation can cause difficulties when trying to integrate Tolstoy, as it may require the flexibility to place blocks on various templates within the theme.

## Potential Solutions

To address this issue, consider the following approaches:

1. **Upgrade to a Newer Theme Version**: If possible, upgrading to a version 2 theme or later can resolve the issue, as these versions typically offer more flexibility in block placement.
2. **Modify the Theme**: If upgrading is not an option, you may need to modify the existing theme to allow block placement on non-homepage templates. This may require technical expertise in theme development.

By understanding the root cause of the setup issues with Tolstoy on version 1 themes, users can take appropriate steps to resolve them and ensure a smoother integration process.
