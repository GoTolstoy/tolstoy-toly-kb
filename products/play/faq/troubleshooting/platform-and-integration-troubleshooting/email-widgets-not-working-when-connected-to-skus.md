# Email Widgets Not Working When Connected to SKUs

## Understanding the Issue

When email widgets are connected to SKUs, they may not function as expected. This issue arises because the email widgets require at least **three videos** that match the product from the event trigger to display the GIF. If the trigger is set by SKU rather than by product, it can lead to problems.

## Requirements for Email Widgets

For the email widgets to work correctly, ensure the following:

1. **Event Trigger by Product**: The event trigger should be set by product rather than by SKU.
2. **Minimum Video Requirement**: There should be at least three videos that match the product from the event trigger.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Event Trigger**: Verify that the event trigger is set by product and not by SKU.
2. **Verify Video Count**: Ensure there are at least three videos that match the product from the event trigger.

By following these steps, you can resolve the issue and ensure that the email widgets function correctly when connected to products.
