# Making Links Open in a New Tab

When creating links, you might want them to open in a new tab to keep the current page accessible. This can be particularly useful for external links or additional resources. Here's how you can achieve this:

## Using HTML

To make a link open in a new tab using HTML, include the `target='_blank'` attribute in your anchor (`<a>`) tag. For example:

```
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
```

This code will open the link in a new tab when clicked.

## Using Platform Settings

If you are using a platform that generates links for you, such as a content management system (CMS) or a website builder, check the settings or options available. Many platforms provide an option to set the link to open in a new tab. Look for a checkbox or a toggle labeled something like "Open link in new tab" or "Target: _blank".

By following these steps, you can ensure that your links open in a new tab, providing a better user experience by keeping the original page accessible.
