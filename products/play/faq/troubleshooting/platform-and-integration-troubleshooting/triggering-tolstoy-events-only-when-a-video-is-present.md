## Triggering Tolstoy Events Only When a Video is Present

When working with Tolstoy events, a common concern is whether these events can be triggered only when a video is present on the page. This is a valid concern, especially for those looking to ensure that their analytics are accurate and relevant.

### Confirming with the Development Team

To address this concern, it is essential to confirm with the development team. They can provide specific insights and technical details on how to set up the events in GA4 (Google Analytics 4) to trigger only when a video is present on the page.

### Likely Possibility

While confirmation is necessary, it is likely possible to configure Tolstoy events in such a way. By setting up the appropriate conditions and triggers within GA4, you can ensure that events are only fired when a video is detected on the page. This setup helps maintain the accuracy of your data and ensures that your analytics reflect actual user interactions with video content.

### Next Steps

1. **Consult the Development Team**: Reach out to your development team to discuss the technical feasibility and implementation details.
2. **Set Up Conditions in GA4**: Work with your team to establish the necessary conditions and triggers within GA4 to ensure events are only triggered when a video is present.
3. **Test and Validate**: After implementation, thoroughly test the setup to confirm that events are being triggered correctly and only under the specified conditions.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage Tolstoy events and ensure they are only triggered when relevant video content is present on the page.
