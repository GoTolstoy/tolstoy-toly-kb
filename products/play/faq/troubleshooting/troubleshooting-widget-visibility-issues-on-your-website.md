### The Widget is Set to Appear on the Wrong Address

1. Navigate to Rules.
2. Go to Pages. Check if your widget is set on specific pages. If it's set to specific pages but empty or includes the wrong address, the widget will not appear. If you want your widget to appear at a specific address, make sure that the correct address is pasted. Click on Save.

### Widget Code Isn't Pasted or Is Posted in the Wrong Place

Make sure that the widget code is pasted in its entirety and in the header of your site. Also, ensure to click the complete button on the installation page once you're done.
