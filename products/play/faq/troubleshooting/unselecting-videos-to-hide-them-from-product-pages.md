## Unselecting Videos to Hide Them from Product Pages

To unselect or hide videos from a Tolstoy video, you can do it in two ways:

### Removing the Video Tag

1. In the Tolstoy Dashboard, go to the **Library** tab and remove the product tag from the video you donâ€™t want to show.
2. Once you have finished untagging videos, go back to the Tolstoy project. This will automatically update your feed with the recently added or removed videos.
3. Make sure that the Playlist is set to "Product tagged" only.

### Hiding the Video

1. You can also directly hide the videos from the "Videos" tab of the Tolstoy project.
2. There is a hide button on the upper right-hand corner of the video you want to hide.
3. Once done, click Save. If you change your mind and want to unhide the video, click "Show".
