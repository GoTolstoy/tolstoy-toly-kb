## Why Are There So Many Files in the Theme Assets?

We used to store video files in the theme assets so they would load faster via Shopify CDN and appear at the top of the waterfall on page load, ensuring they wouldn't hurt core web vitals.

However, we've since realized this wasn't the best location for the files, and we've updated our process. Today, we store videos in files, so these are actually old assets that can be deleted. We just prefer not to delete anything from this area on customers' behalf.
