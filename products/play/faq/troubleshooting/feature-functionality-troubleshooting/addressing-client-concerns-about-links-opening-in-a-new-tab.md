## Addressing Client Concerns About Links Opening in a New Tab

To address client concerns about links opening in a new tab on a non-RMS hosted link, ensure that the `target='_blank'` attribute is included in the HTML for the link. This attribute instructs the browser to open the link in a new tab.

If there are specific issues or bugs related to this functionality, communicate to the clients that these issues are being worked on. Provide regular updates to keep them informed about the progress and expected resolution timelines.
