# How a CSM Should Follow Up on a Technical Issue

When a Customer Success Manager (CSM) follows up on a technical issue, it is crucial to ensure clear communication and thorough verification of the client's needs. Here are the steps a CSM should take:

## Confirm Specific Requirements

The first step is to confirm the specific requirements from the client. This involves understanding the issue in detail and ensuring that all necessary information is gathered. Clear and precise communication with the client is essential to avoid any misunderstandings.

## Provide a Preview of the Changes

Before making any updates live, the CSM should provide a preview of the changes to the client. This allows the client to see what the updates will look like and how they will function. Providing a preview helps in identifying any potential issues or adjustments that may be needed before the final implementation.

## Seek Approval

After presenting the preview, the CSM should seek approval from the client. This step is crucial as it ensures that the client is satisfied with the proposed changes and agrees to proceed with the updates. Approval from the client helps in maintaining a transparent and collaborative relationship.

By following these steps, a CSM can effectively manage and resolve technical issues, ensuring client satisfaction and successful implementation of updates.
