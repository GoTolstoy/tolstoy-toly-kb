# Improving GA4 Data Accuracy with Tolstoy

## Introduction

When using Tolstoy, ensuring the accuracy of your Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data is crucial for making informed decisions. Inaccurate data can lead to misguided strategies and missed opportunities. This article will discuss how to improve the accuracy of GA4 data when using Tolstoy.

## Filtering Unwanted Tolstoy Events Using GTM

One effective way to enhance the accuracy of your GA4 data is by filtering out unwanted Tolstoy events using Google Tag Manager (GTM). GTM allows you to manage and deploy marketing tags (snippets of code) on your website without modifying the code directly. By setting up filters in GTM, you can ensure that only relevant Tolstoy events are sent to GA4, thereby improving data accuracy.

### Steps to Filter Events Using GTM
1. **Log in to your GTM account** and select the container for your website.
2. **Create a new trigger** that specifies the conditions under which Tolstoy events should be sent to GA4.
3. **Set up a new tag** in GTM that sends the filtered Tolstoy events to GA4.
4. **Test your setup** to ensure that only the desired events are being tracked.

## Manually Adding Code to Handle Specific Events

Another method to improve GA4 data accuracy is by manually adding code to handle specific Tolstoy events. This approach gives you more control over which events are tracked and how they are reported in GA4.

### Steps to Manually Add Code
1. **Identify the specific Tolstoy events** you want to track.
2. **Write custom JavaScript code** to handle these events. This code should include logic to filter out any unwanted events.
3. **Implement the code** on your website, ensuring it is correctly integrated with your existing GA4 setup.
4. **Test the implementation** to verify that only the desired events are being tracked and reported accurately.

## Conclusion

Improving the accuracy of GA4 data when using Tolstoy is essential for reliable analytics. By filtering unwanted Tolstoy events using GTM or manually adding code to handle specific events, you can ensure that your GA4 data is accurate and actionable. Implement these strategies to make the most out of your analytics and drive better decision-making.
