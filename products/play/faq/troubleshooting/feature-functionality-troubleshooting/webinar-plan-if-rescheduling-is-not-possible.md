## Webinar Plan if Rescheduling is Not Possible

If the webinar cannot be rescheduled, the team will proceed with the webinar as initially planned. They will leverage the recording of the webinar for various purposes, including social media, email marketing, and newsletters. This approach ensures that the content reaches a wider audience even if the live event cannot be moved to a different date.
