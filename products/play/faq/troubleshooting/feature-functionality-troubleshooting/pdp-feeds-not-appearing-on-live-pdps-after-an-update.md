# PDP Feeds Not Appearing on Live PDPs After an Update

## Technical Issues

If you are experiencing issues with PDP feeds not appearing on live PDPs after an update, it is important to note that PDP stories are only available on selected product pages. This limitation might be due to an internal setup with the developers. Ensure that the product pages in question are among those selected to display PDP stories. If the issue persists, it may be necessary to consult with the development team to verify the setup and resolve any potential configuration problems.
