# Language Localization Issues in Video Captions

## Overview

Clients have reported facing significant issues with language localization in video captions. The primary problem is that updating a caption in one language automatically changes it across all other languages. This issue creates confusion and inefficiency, especially for users who need to provide accurate translations in multiple languages.

## Specific Issues

### Automatic Caption Changes

When a user updates a caption in one language, the system automatically applies this change to all other languages. This behavior is problematic because it prevents users from maintaining distinct captions for different languages, which is essential for accurate localization.

### Unclear User Interface

The user interface (UI) is also unclear, making it difficult for users to understand how to manage captions for multiple languages effectively. The lack of clear instructions or intuitive design elements exacerbates the problem, leading to user frustration.

## Workaround

### Uploading Separate Videos

As a workaround, clients have resorted to uploading the same videos multiple times, each time for a different language. This method allows them to manually add subtitles for each language, ensuring that the captions remain accurate and distinct. While this approach is not ideal, it provides a temporary solution until the underlying issues are resolved.

## Conclusion

The issues with language localization in video captions significantly impact the user experience. Automatic caption changes and an unclear UI are the main problems. Until these issues are addressed, the workaround of uploading separate videos for each language remains the best available solution.
