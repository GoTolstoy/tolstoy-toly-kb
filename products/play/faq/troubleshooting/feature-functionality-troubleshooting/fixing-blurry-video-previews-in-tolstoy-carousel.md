# Fixing Blurry Video Previews in Tolstoy Carousel

## Understanding the Issue

Blurriness in video previews within the Tolstoy carousel can be a common issue. This blurriness is often caused by a script that sets the poster width to a very low value, such as 100px. For optimal display, the poster width should ideally be around 800px.

## Steps to Fix the Blurriness

1. **Identify the Script**: Check your theme settings to identify any script that might be affecting the image previews. This script could be setting the poster width to 100px, causing the blurriness.

2. **Adjust the Poster Width**: Once you have identified the script, adjust the poster width setting to around 800px. This should significantly improve the clarity of the video previews.

3. **Test the Changes**: After making the adjustments, test the video previews in the Tolstoy carousel to ensure that the blurriness has been resolved.

By following these steps, you can fix the blurriness of video previews in the Tolstoy carousel and ensure a better visual experience for your users.
