## Handling Outdated Promotional Videos

Customer Success Managers (CSMs) play a crucial role in ensuring that promotional content remains relevant and effective. When dealing with outdated promotional videos, CSMs should take the following steps:

1. **Confirm Relevance**: Reach out to the client to confirm whether the promotional video is still relevant. This ensures that the content aligns with the client's current marketing strategy and goals.

2. **Turn Off or Replace**: If the video is no longer relevant, CSMs should either turn it off or replace it with a current promotion. This helps maintain the effectiveness of the promotional efforts and ensures that the audience receives up-to-date information.

By following these steps, CSMs can help clients keep their promotional content fresh and impactful.
