# Handling Client-Reported Technical Issues

## Immediate Actions

When a client reports a technical issue, it is crucial to act promptly to maintain client satisfaction and trust. The following steps should be taken:

1. **Acknowledge the Issue**: Immediately acknowledge the client's report and assure them that the issue is being taken seriously.

2. **Gather Information**: Collect all necessary details about the issue from the client. This includes error messages, steps to reproduce the issue, and any other relevant information.

## Raising a Ticket

Once the initial information is gathered, the Customer Success Manager (CSM) should raise a ticket with the development team. The ticket should include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any error messages or logs provided by the client
- The urgency of the issue based on its impact on the client

## Keeping the Client Updated

After raising the ticket, it is important to keep the client informed about the progress. Regular updates should be provided, including:

- Confirmation that the ticket has been raised
- Any progress made by the development team
- Expected timelines for resolution

## Follow-Up

Once the issue is resolved, follow up with the client to ensure that the solution is satisfactory and that no further issues have arisen. This helps in maintaining a positive relationship and demonstrates a commitment to excellent customer service.
