## Client Concerns About Tolstoy Video

### Intrusiveness of the Video Popup

One of the primary concerns raised by the client was that the Tolstoy video popup was **intrusive**. This means that the video appeared in a way that disrupted the user experience, potentially causing frustration or annoyance to the viewers. Ensuring that video popups are user-friendly and non-intrusive is crucial for maintaining a positive interaction with the audience.

### Video Format

Another concern highlighted by the client was the **format of the video**. Specifically, the client noted that the video was in portrait format instead of landscape. Landscape format is often preferred for videos as it provides a wider view and is generally more compatible with various devices and screen sizes. Addressing this concern would involve reformatting the video to landscape to meet the client's expectations and improve the viewing experience.
