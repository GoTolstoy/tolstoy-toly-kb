## Troubleshooting Hero Video Loading Issues

If the hero video is not loading correctly on the homepage, the first step is to ensure that all settings are properly configured. This includes checking the video URL, ensuring the video file is accessible, and verifying that any necessary plugins or scripts are correctly implemented.

If these settings are confirmed to be correct and the issue persists, it is recommended to escalate the problem to the development team for further investigation. The development team can perform a more in-depth analysis to identify and resolve any underlying technical issues that may be causing the video to fail to load.
