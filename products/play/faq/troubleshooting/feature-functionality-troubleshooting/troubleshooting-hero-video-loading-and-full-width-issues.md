## Troubleshooting Hero Video Loading and Full Width Issues

### Why is my hero video not loading?

The hero video may not load if all required elements (Desktop video, Mobile video, and redirect link) are not populated. Ensure that each of these elements is correctly set up to avoid loading issues.

### How can I make the hero video full width?

The hero video should be full width by default. If it is not displaying as full width, check your theme settings to ensure there are no margins on the left and right of the hero section. Adjusting these settings should resolve the issue.
