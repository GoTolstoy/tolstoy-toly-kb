# Technical Issues with Drafted Products in Carousel Videos

## Overview
Christine reported a technical issue related to drafted products in carousel videos. Specifically, she noted that a drafted product was incorrectly displayed as 'in-stock' and caused an error when added to the cart.

## Details
### Problem Description
The issue arises when a product that is still in draft status appears in a carousel video. Despite being a draft, the product is shown as 'in-stock' to users. This misleading information leads to a problematic user experience.

### Error Encountered
When users attempt to add the drafted product to their cart, an error occurs. This is likely because the system recognizes the product's draft status and prevents it from being added to the cart, despite its 'in-stock' label.

## Implications
This issue can lead to user frustration and a lack of trust in the platform's reliability. It is crucial to ensure that only products that are fully published and available for purchase are displayed as 'in-stock' in carousel videos.

## Recommendations
- **Review Product Status:** Ensure that the system accurately reflects the status of products in carousel videos.
- **Error Handling:** Implement better error handling to provide users with clear messages when an issue occurs.
- **Quality Assurance:** Conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve such issues before they affect users.

By addressing these recommendations, the platform can improve user experience and maintain trust.
