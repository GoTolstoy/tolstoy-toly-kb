# Alt Text Display in the Player

When incorporating alt text for images in the player, it is important to ensure that the alt text is displayed under the photo. This placement helps users understand the context of the image, especially for those who rely on screen readers or have visual impairments. Properly positioned alt text enhances accessibility and provides a better user experience.
