# Preventing Tolstoy Pop-Up from Appearing on Every Click

To ensure a smooth user experience, it's important to prevent the Tolstoy pop-up from appearing on every click. Instead, the pop-up should be triggered by specific actions or buttons. Here are some steps to achieve this:

## Identify Trigger Points

Determine the specific actions or buttons that should trigger the Tolstoy pop-up. This could be a call-to-action button, a specific link, or any other user interaction that warrants the pop-up.

## Update Event Listeners

Modify the event listeners on your landing page to ensure that the Tolstoy pop-up is only triggered by the identified actions. Remove any global click event listeners that might be causing the pop-up to appear on every click.

### Example Code

Here's an example of how you can update your event listeners to trigger the Tolstoy pop-up only on specific actions:

```javascript
// Select the specific button or element that should trigger the pop-up
const triggerButton = document.getElementById('trigger-button');

// Add an event listener to the trigger button
triggerButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // Code to display the Tolstoy pop-up
  showTolstoyPopup();
});

// Function to display the Tolstoy pop-up
function showTolstoyPopup() {
  // Your code to display the pop-up
  console.log('Tolstoy pop-up displayed');
}
```

## Test and Validate

After updating the event listeners, thoroughly test your landing page to ensure that the Tolstoy pop-up only appears when the specific actions or buttons are clicked. This will help provide a better user experience and prevent unnecessary interruptions.

By following these steps, you can effectively control when the Tolstoy pop-up appears, ensuring it enhances rather than disrupts the user experience.
