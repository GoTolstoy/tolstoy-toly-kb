## How to Follow Up After Making Styling Changes

When you make styling changes, it's important to follow up effectively to ensure that the changes meet the expectations and requirements. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to follow up after making styling changes:

### Provide a Preview Link

After making the styling changes, the first step is to provide a preview link of the draft theme. This allows the reviewer to see the changes in context and understand how they affect the overall design.

### Request Feedback

Once you have shared the preview link, ask the reviewer to go through the changes and provide their feedback. This feedback is crucial for making any necessary adjustments and ensuring that the final design meets the desired standards.

### Example

For instance, Gilbert Castro followed up after making styling changes by providing a preview link of the draft theme and asking Atom Whitman to review the changes and provide feedback. This approach ensures clear communication and helps in refining the design based on constructive input.
