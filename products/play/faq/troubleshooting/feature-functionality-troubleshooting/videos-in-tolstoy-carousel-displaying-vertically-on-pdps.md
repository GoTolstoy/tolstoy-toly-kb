# Videos in Tolstoy Carousel Displaying Vertically on PDPs

## Technical Issues

### Why are the videos in the Tolstoy carousel on PDPs displaying vertically?

This issue could be due to the customization built for the demo video banner. To resolve this, access to the Shopify store is needed to check the codes and ensure that other carousels aren't affected by the customization.
