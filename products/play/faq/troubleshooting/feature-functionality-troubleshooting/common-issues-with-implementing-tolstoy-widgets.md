# Common Issues with Implementing Tolstoy Widgets

When implementing Tolstoy widgets, users may encounter several common issues. These issues can generally be categorized into three main areas: **CSS discrepancies**, **JavaScript functionality problems**, and **alignment or padding issues**.

## CSS Discrepancies
CSS discrepancies occur when the widget's styles conflict with existing styles on the website. This can result in unexpected visual behavior, such as incorrect colors, fonts, or layout issues. To resolve these discrepancies, you may need to adjust the CSS code to ensure compatibility with your website's existing styles.

## JavaScript Functionality Problems
JavaScript functionality problems can arise when there are conflicts between the widget's JavaScript code and other scripts on the website. This can lead to issues such as the widget not loading correctly or interactive elements not functioning as intended. Debugging the JavaScript code and ensuring there are no conflicts with other scripts can help resolve these problems.

## Alignment or Padding Issues
Alignment or padding issues occur when the widget does not align properly with other elements on the page or has incorrect spacing. These issues can often be resolved by adjusting the CSS properties related to alignment and padding to ensure the widget fits seamlessly into the page layout.

By addressing these common issues through careful adjustment of CSS and JavaScript code, you can ensure that Tolstoy widgets function correctly and integrate smoothly with your website.
