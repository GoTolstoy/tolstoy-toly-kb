# Aligning Video Content at the Bottom and Maintaining Aspect Ratios on Mobile

When it comes to aligning video content at the bottom of a container and maintaining aspect ratios on mobile devices, CSS customization is key. Here are some steps and tips to achieve this:

## Aligning Video Content at the Bottom

To align video content at the bottom of a container, you can use CSS properties such as `position`, `bottom`, and `transform`. Here is an example:

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
  height: 100%;
}

.video {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

In this example, the video is positioned absolutely within its container and aligned to the bottom using the `bottom: 0;` property.

## Maintaining Aspect Ratios on Mobile

Maintaining aspect ratios on mobile devices can be more complex and may require advanced CSS or JavaScript. One common approach is to use the `padding-top` or `padding-bottom` trick to create a responsive container. Here is an example:

```css
.responsive-container {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */
  height: 0;
}

.responsive-container iframe,
.responsive-container video {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

In this example, the `padding-bottom` property is set to 56.25%, which corresponds to a 16:9 aspect ratio. The video or iframe is then positioned absolutely within the container to fill the available space while maintaining the aspect ratio.

## Seeking Development Team Assistance
