## Causes of Feature Rollout Delays

When it comes to rolling out new features, several factors can contribute to delays. In this case, the primary reasons for the delay were **the team being on holiday** and **miscommunication regarding the implementation of the new features**.

### Team Availability

One significant factor was the team being on holiday. When key team members are unavailable, it can slow down the development and implementation process, leading to delays in the rollout schedule.

### Miscommunication

Another critical factor was miscommunication regarding the implementation of the new features. Effective communication is essential for coordinating tasks and ensuring that everyone is on the same page. Miscommunication can lead to misunderstandings, errors, and ultimately, delays in the project timeline.

Understanding these factors can help in planning better for future rollouts and mitigating potential delays.
