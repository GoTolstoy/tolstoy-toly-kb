When you connect per workspace, you'll need to check all the Instagram pages that are going to be linked to Tolstoy every time. If not, it will revoke the previously given permissions for the other accounts.

Here are the steps you need to follow in Facebook after clicking connect in the Tolstoy app:

1. Click **Edit previous settings**.
