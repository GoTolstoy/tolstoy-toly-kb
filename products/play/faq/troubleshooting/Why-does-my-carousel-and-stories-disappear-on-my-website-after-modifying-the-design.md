## Why does my carousel and stories disappear/do not appear on my website after modifying the design?

It could be related to the **Minimum number of videos** feature. Please ensure that it's always set to **1** to be on the safe side. 

The widget will not appear at all unless the minimum number of videos is met (for example: if you set the minimum number to 3, and a certain product has only 2 videos, no videos will appear at all). 

You can modify this feature under the **Design tab -> Widget -> Layout -> Minimum number of videos**.
