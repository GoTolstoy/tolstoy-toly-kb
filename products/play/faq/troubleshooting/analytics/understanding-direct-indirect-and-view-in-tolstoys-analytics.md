## Understanding Direct, Indirect, and View in Tolstoy's Analytics

In Tolstoy's analytics, it is essential to understand the terms 'direct,' 'indirect,' and 'view' to effectively measure and analyze user engagement with your content.

### Direct

**Direct** refers to users who interact with your content directly through a specific link. This means that the user has accessed your content by clicking on a direct URL, such as a link shared via email or a direct bookmark.

### Indirect

**Indirect** refers to users who find your content through other means, such as search engines or social media platforms. These users have not accessed your content through a direct link but have discovered it through various other channels.

### View

**View** refers to the number of times your content has been viewed. This metric helps you understand the reach and visibility of your content, regardless of how users have accessed it.
