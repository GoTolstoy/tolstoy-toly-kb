## Hiding Certain Product Videos in the Home Feed

To hide certain product videos in the home feed, you need to create a 'Popular videos' feed. By default, the home feed captures all videos with at least one product tagged. You can then hide videos you don't want to appear by hovering over the video thumbnail and clicking the eye button.

## Setting a Specific Thumbnail for a Video

To set a specific thumbnail for a video, go to the Library tab, find the video you want to edit, click the three dots icon, and then select 'Set thumbnail.'

## Troubleshooting Non-Populating Videos

If a video created in Tolstoy Studio doesn't populate, check if the video appears within a few hours. If it still doesn't show up, escalate the issue to the technical team for further investigation.
