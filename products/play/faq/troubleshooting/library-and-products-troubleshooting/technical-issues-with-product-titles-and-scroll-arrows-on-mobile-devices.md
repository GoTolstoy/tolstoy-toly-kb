## Technical Issues with Product Titles and Scroll Arrows on Mobile Devices

The client reported two main technical issues. Firstly, they experienced problems with product titles getting cut off. This means that the full titles of products were not being displayed, which could lead to confusion or difficulty in identifying products correctly.

Secondly, the client noted the absence of scroll arrows on mobile devices. Scroll arrows are essential for navigation, especially on smaller screens where space is limited. Without these arrows, users may find it challenging to browse through content efficiently.

Addressing these issues is crucial for improving user experience and ensuring that product information is fully accessible on all devices.
