# What to Do If Your Video File Is Too Large to Upload to Tolstoy

If you encounter an issue where your video file is too large to upload to Tolstoy, there are several steps you can take to resolve this problem.

## Compress the Video

One effective solution is to compress the video file. You can use tools like Handbrake or Adobe Media Encoder to reduce the file size without significantly compromising the quality. These tools offer various settings to help you find the right balance between file size and video quality.

## Upgrade Your Plan

Another option is to upgrade your Tolstoy plan. Different plans come with varying file size limits, so upgrading your plan can increase the maximum file size you are allowed to upload. Check the Tolstoy website for details on the available plans and their respective limits.

## Split the Video

If compressing the video or upgrading your plan is not feasible, consider splitting the video into smaller parts. This can be done using video editing software. By dividing the video into smaller segments, each part will be within the upload limit, allowing you to upload them separately.

By following these steps, you can successfully upload your video to Tolstoy even if it initially exceeds the file size limit.
