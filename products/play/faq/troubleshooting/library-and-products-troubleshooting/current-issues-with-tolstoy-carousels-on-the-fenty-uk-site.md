## Current Issues with Tolstoy Carousels on the Fenty UK Site

The Fenty UK site is currently experiencing technical issues with its Tolstoy carousels. The primary problems include:

1. **Incorrect PUBLISH IDs**: The product pages are displaying incorrect PUBLISH IDs, which can lead to improper tracking and display of carousel content.

2. **Improper Carousel Positions**: In the live preview theme, the carousels are not positioned correctly, affecting the overall layout and user experience on the site.

These issues need to be addressed to ensure the carousels function as intended and provide a seamless experience for users.
