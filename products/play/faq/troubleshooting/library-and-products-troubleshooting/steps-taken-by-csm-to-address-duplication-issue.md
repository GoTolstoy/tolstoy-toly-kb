## Steps Taken by CSM to Address Duplication Issue

To address the duplication issue, the Customer Success Manager (CSM) took the following steps:

1. **Manually Hid Duplicated Videos**: The CSM identified and manually hid the duplicated videos to ensure they were no longer visible.

2. **Untagged Videos with Same Product**: The CSM untagged videos that included the same product as the other copies to avoid confusion and redundancy.

3. **Provided New Tagging Approach**: To prevent future duplication, the CSM provided a new tagging approach. This new method aims to streamline the tagging process and ensure that each product is tagged uniquely, reducing the chances of duplication.
