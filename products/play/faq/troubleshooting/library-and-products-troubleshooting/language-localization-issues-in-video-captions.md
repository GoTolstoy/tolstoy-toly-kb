## Language Localization Issues in Video Captions

The client encountered significant challenges with language localization in video captions. Specifically, when they updated a caption in one language, the change was automatically applied across all other languages. This issue was compounded by an unclear user interface, which led to further confusion.

As a workaround, the client had to upload the same videos separately for each language and manually add the appropriate subtitles. This process was cumbersome and time-consuming, highlighting the need for a more intuitive and efficient solution for managing multilingual video captions.
