# Older Videos Not Showing Up on Webpage

## Introduction

If you are experiencing issues with older videos not showing up on your webpage, it could be due to problems with linking videos from Instagram or a shared drive. This article will help you understand potential causes and steps to investigate the issue further.

## Potential Causes

### Linking Issues from Instagram

One common reason for older videos not appearing on your webpage is a problem with the links from Instagram. Instagram links can sometimes change or become invalid, especially if the content has been moved, deleted, or if there are changes in Instagram's API.

### Shared Drive Issues

Another potential cause could be issues with the shared drive where the videos are stored. If the shared drive's permissions have changed, or if the files have been moved or deleted, the links on your webpage may no longer be valid.

## Steps to Investigate

### Check Instagram Links

1. Verify that the links to the older videos on Instagram are still valid.
2. Ensure that the videos have not been deleted or moved.
3. Check for any changes in Instagram's API that might affect video linking.

### Check Shared Drive Links

1. Confirm that the videos are still present in the shared drive.
2. Verify that the permissions for the shared drive have not changed.
3. Ensure that the file paths have not been altered.

## Conclusion

By investigating the potential issues with Instagram links and shared drive permissions, you can identify the root cause of why older videos are not showing up on your webpage. Addressing these issues should help restore the visibility of the videos.
