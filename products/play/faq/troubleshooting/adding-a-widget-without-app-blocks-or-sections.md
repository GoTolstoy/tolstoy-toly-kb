## Adding a Widget Without App Blocks or Sections

If you don’t see any app blocks or sections, you may need to add your Tolstoy widget via code. You can watch a tutorial [here](https://share.synthesia.io/bd6215d0-bc3b-40de-8487-0d1a2e6a5997) or follow the instructions below:

1. In your Tolstoy Dashboard, go to Onsite, select the Tolstoy project you created, click the “Publish” button on the top right, then click the “Use code instead” dropdown and click “Copy code.”

2. Once you have copied the code, go to your Shopify admin, navigate to Online Store > Themes, click on the three dots of the theme where you want to add the Tolstoy video, and click Edit code.

3. You now need to find the file of the page where you want to add the Tolstoy widget. If you’re adding it to a product page, the file name is `product-template.liquid`. If you don’t find that file, you may need to ask for help from your development team.

4. Once you have found the file, paste the code snippet from Tolstoy in the code line where you want the Tolstoy video to appear, and hit Save.
