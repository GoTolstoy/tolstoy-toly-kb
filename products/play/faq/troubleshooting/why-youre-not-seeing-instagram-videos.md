## Why You're Not Seeing Instagram Videos

Common reasons why you're not seeing Instagram videos:

1. **Video Source:** You're only able to see the videos you created directly on your Instagram account in Tolstoy. Tagged videos from other accounts won't automatically show up. If you need those videos, you can manually download and upload them to your Tolstoy account. Here's a tool that might help with downloading Instagram videos: [SnapInsta](https://snapinsta.app/instagram-reels-video-download).

2. **Copyrighted Music:** Videos that have copyrighted music will not sync to the library.

3. **Integration Settings:** Make sure your Instagram account is properly connected in your Tolstoy integrations.

4. **Sync Issues:** Sometimes, there might be a delay in syncing the videos from Instagram to Tolstoy. You can try refreshing the integration.

5. **Permissions:** Ensure that all necessary permissions are granted to Tolstoy to access your Instagram videos.
