## Incorrect Videos of Widgets Appearing on Product Pages

If you want to see all videos within the selected playlists on all your product pages and not just the videos with that product tagged, go to the widget’s settings below the publish button and select **Allow non-tagged videos on PDPs**.

## I added my Tolstoy widget to my product pages, but I only want videos tagged with that product to appear.

To ensure videos are only displayed on product pages where the respective product is tagged, go to the widget’s settings and deselect **Allow non-tagged videos on PDPs**.
