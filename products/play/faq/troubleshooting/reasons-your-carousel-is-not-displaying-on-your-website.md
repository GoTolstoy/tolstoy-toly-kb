## Reasons Your Carousel is Not Displaying on Your Website

There could be a few reasons why the carousel is not displaying.

1. Make sure that the minimal number of videos is set to 1. You can edit this on the **Design** tab. Click **Widget**, look for the **Layout** section, and set **Minimal number of videos** to **1**.

2. Ensure the Tolstoy app is enabled in App embeds. Go to your **Shopify theme**, choose **App embed**, and enable Tolstoy by turning on the toggle.

3. Make sure that you added a carousel block/section and inserted the publish ID.

4. Make sure to click the publish button and follow the steps shown in the app.
