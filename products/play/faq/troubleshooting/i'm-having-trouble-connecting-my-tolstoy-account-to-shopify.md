## I'm having trouble connecting my Tolstoy account to Shopify, as it says it's already connected but I keep going round in circles.

If you have several or multiple Shopify accounts/stores, it could be that you have already installed Tolstoy to one of those stores that's why you're getting an error saying it's already connected. First, check all of your Shopify stores and make sure to uninstall Tolstoy from there. Once done, go back to the Tolstoy app, go to Integrations and connect the correct Shopify store/app URL.
