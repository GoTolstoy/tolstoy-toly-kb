# Homepage Project Video Behavior

## Variables Influencing Video Display

1. **Project Type**: A Homepage project will display all videos together, regardless of individual product tags.
2. **Target Page**: When a Homepage project is implemented on a homepage, all videos are displayed together with no product-specific filtering.
3. **Non-tagged Videos on PDPs Setting**:
   - Toggled On (Default): Will show all videos on PDP.
   - Toggled Off: Will only show product-specific on PDP.

## Expected Behavior

When a Homepage Project is placed on a Homepage:
- All videos will be displayed, and no filtering will occur based on product.
- Pinning functionality from the app is reflected accurately on the site.

## Common Bugs

1. **Videos not appearing**: Ensure the project type is set as a Homepage project and that the target page is indeed a homepage.
2. **Pinning issues**: Confirm that videos have been pinned correctly in the app. If pinning is not reflected, double-check the project configuration.
