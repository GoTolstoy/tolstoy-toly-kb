## Contract And Month-To-Month Options For Account Management

When managing your account with Tolstoy, you have the flexibility to choose between a contract or a month-to-month arrangement. This decision can be tailored to meet your specific needs and preferences.

### Contract Option
Opting for a contract can provide stability and potentially better terms for your account management. Contracts are typically discussed and agreed upon during a meeting with Tolstoy representatives, ensuring that all your requirements and expectations are clearly outlined and met.

### Month-To-Month Option
If you prefer more flexibility, the month-to-month option allows you to manage your account without a long-term commitment. This can be ideal for clients who anticipate changes in their needs or who prefer not to be tied down by a contract.

### Discussing Your Options
To determine which option is best for you, it is recommended to discuss your needs during a meeting with Tolstoy. Their team will help you understand the benefits and implications of each choice, ensuring that you make an informed decision that aligns with your business goals.
