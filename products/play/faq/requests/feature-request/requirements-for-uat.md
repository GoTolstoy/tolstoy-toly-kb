## Requirements for UAT

To ensure the widget is implemented correctly and matches brand guidelines, the following items are needed for User Acceptance Testing (UAT):

1. **Figma designs**: These provide the visual layout and design specifications.
2. **Fonts**: Specific fonts that align with the brand's visual identity.
3. **GA4 tracking ID**: This is necessary for tracking and analytics purposes.

These elements will help ensure that the widget meets the required standards and functions as expected.
