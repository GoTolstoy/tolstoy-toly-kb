# Muting or Unmuting Videos

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps to mute and unmute videos for your video feeds. Whether you're a brand looking to showcase your videos without any music copyright issues or simply want to have more control over the audio in your video content, this feature will help you achieve your goals.

## Muting Videos

There are two methods for muting videos: using the default global setting or manual removal/restoration.

### Method 1: Global Setting

If you want to remove the sound from all your videos by default, you can use the global setting. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section by clicking on the **Settings** button.
2. Go to the **Branding** section and click on **Controls**.
3. Enable the **Sound remove from videos by default** toggle.

Once you've turned on this setting, all the videos in your library will be muted. When you play these videos on your website or video feeds, they will not play any sound.

*Please note, once you manually change the sound on videos (see below), that video will no longer be controlled by the default settings and you will have to manually change its sound removal/restoration.*

### Method 2: Manual Removal/Restoration

If you only need to remove sound from specific videos or want to restore sound to videos that have been muted, you can use the manual removal/restoration method. Follow these steps:

1. In your video **Library**, click on the multi-selector to choose the videos you want to modify.
2. Select the videos that have music copyright issues or those you want to mute.

3. Click on the "Remove sound" button to mute the selected videos. You'll see an indicator on these videos confirming the action.

## Unmuting Videos

To restore sound to muted videos:

1. Select the muted videos using the multi-selector.
2. Click on the "Restore sound" button to bring back the audio for the selected videos.

Note that any manual changes you make will override the global setting. So, if you've set the global setting to remove sound by default but manually restore sound to specific videos, those videos will play with audio.

## Previewing Video Sound

If you want to preview the sound of a video that has been muted:

1. Click on the video to open it in the video player.
2. Click the "Unmute" button to hear the audio.

This preview feature allows you to review the video's audio without affecting the muted setting for playback on your website or video feeds.
