## Tolstoy Feature Requests: Pop-Up Display and Colorway Reflection

### Pop-Up Display for Tolstoy Stories

Yes, Tolstoy stories can be displayed as a pop-up instead of a full page. To enable this feature, you need to toggle off 'view feed in full screen' under the Behavior section in the design tab of your feed settings.

### Reflecting Colorways in Tolstoy Videos

Tolstoy can reflect the color of the video to display first when there are multiple colorways. By tagging a video on a variant level, the specific video will show when the variant is selected.
