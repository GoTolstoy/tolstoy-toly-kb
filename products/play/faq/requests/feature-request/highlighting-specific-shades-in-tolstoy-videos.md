# Highlighting Specific Shades in Tolstoy Videos

## Current Status

Currently, Tolstoy does not support the feature to highlight specific shades in videos directly. This means that users cannot select and emphasize particular colors or shades within their video content using Tolstoy's existing tools.

## Feature Request

A request has been raised to develop the capability to highlight specific shades in Tolstoy videos. This feature would allow users to draw attention to particular colors or shades, enhancing the visual impact and clarity of their video content. The development team is aware of this request, and it may be considered for future updates.

## Conclusion

While the ability to highlight specific shades in Tolstoy videos is not currently available, it is a recognized feature request. Users interested in this functionality should stay tuned for potential updates from the Tolstoy development team.
