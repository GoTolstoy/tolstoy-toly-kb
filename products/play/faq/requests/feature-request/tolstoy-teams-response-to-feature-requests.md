# Tolstoy Team's Response to Feature Requests

When users submit feature requests to the Tolstoy team, they can expect a prompt and efficient response. The Tolstoy team quickly adds the requested feature to their development cycle. This means that the feature is prioritized and scheduled for development. Once the feature is developed, the team confirms its deployment, ensuring that users have access to the new functionality as soon as possible.

This proactive approach demonstrates the Tolstoy team's commitment to continuously improving their platform based on user feedback. By integrating user-requested features into their development cycle, they ensure that the platform evolves to meet the needs and expectations of its users.
