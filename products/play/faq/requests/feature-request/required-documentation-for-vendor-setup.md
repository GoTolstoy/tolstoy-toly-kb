## Required Documentation for Vendor Setup

When setting up a vendor, the following documentation is required:

1. **Void Check or Bank Letter**: This is necessary to verify the vendor's banking information.
2. **Signed W9 (for US suppliers)**: This form is required for tax purposes and to verify the vendor's taxpayer identification number.
3. **Vendor Setup Form**: This form collects essential information about the vendor, such as contact details and business information.
4. **Code of Conduct**: This document outlines the ethical standards and practices that the vendor is expected to adhere to.
5. **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**: This agreement ensures that any confidential information shared between the parties remains protected.

Ensuring that all these documents are properly completed and submitted is crucial for a smooth vendor setup process.
