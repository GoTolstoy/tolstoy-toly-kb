## Required Documentation for Vendor Setup

When setting up a vendor, it is essential to gather the necessary documentation to ensure compliance and proper processing. The required documentation includes:

1. **Void Check or Bank Letter**: This is needed to verify the vendor's banking information for payment purposes.
2. **Signed W9 (for US Suppliers)**: This form is required for tax purposes and to verify the vendor's taxpayer identification number.
3. **Vendor Setup Form**: This form collects essential information about the vendor, including contact details and business information.
4. **Code of Conduct**: This document outlines the ethical standards and practices that the vendor is expected to adhere to.
5. **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**: This agreement ensures that any confidential information shared between the parties is protected.

Collecting these documents helps streamline the vendor setup process and ensures that all necessary information is on file.
