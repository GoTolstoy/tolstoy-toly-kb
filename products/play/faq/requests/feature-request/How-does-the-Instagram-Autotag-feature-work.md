## How does the Instagram Autotag feature work?

The Autotag feature automatically tags products in Tolstoy videos for connected Instagram accounts, using the products tagged with Instagram Shopping tags.

### Here's how to set it up:

1. Go to Library -> Instagram -> Click the **Autotag** button.

2. You can choose to enable "Automatically sync product tags on your videos with Instagram Shopping tags," or "Sync Instagram Shopping tags to videos that have already been tagged." You may also enable both options. After making your selections, click the **Save** button.
