# Feature Requests for Tolstoy

## Grouping Photos by Color Variant Using Alt Text

Currently, Tolstoy does not support referencing alt text to group photos per color variant. However, this feature request has been noted for future enhancements. This means that while you cannot use alt text for this purpose at the moment, it is a potential feature that may be included in future updates to improve the platform's functionality.
