# Following Up After Making Changes to an Email Campaign

After making changes to an email campaign, it is crucial to follow up with the client to ensure everything is correct and meets their expectations. Here are the steps you should take:

## Confirm Changes

First, reach out to the client to confirm that the changes you made are accurate. This can be done through a quick email or a phone call. Clearly outline the changes you made and ask the client to review them.

## Request a Test Email

Next, request a test or example email from the client. This will allow you to see how the changes look in a real email and ensure that everything is functioning as expected. A test email can help identify any issues that may not have been apparent during the initial review.

## Provide Feedback

Once you receive the test email, review it carefully and provide feedback to the client. If there are any issues or further changes needed, communicate these clearly and work with the client to resolve them.

## Final Confirmation

Finally, once all changes have been reviewed and approved, send a final confirmation to the client. This ensures that both parties are on the same page and that the email campaign is ready to go live.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the email campaign changes are accurate and meet the client's expectations.
