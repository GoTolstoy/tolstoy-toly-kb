## Email Widget Use Cases

There are two types of carousel widgets. One is dynamic, suitable for email flows triggered by a product-related event. The other is suitable for email campaigns showing the same content in all emails sent.

## Email Campaigns - Trending Videos

The 'Trending videos' use case is great to add to a newsletter, product launch, and even to a welcome flow. Even though it's designed for campaigns, it can be used in a flow, but it would show the same videos no matter what the trigger is.

### Setting the GIF Behavior

By default, the 'Product tagged' and 'Trending videos' playlists are selected, and the GIF links to a New TV page. Under Design in the GIF section, users can change the link to a specific page on their store. If a specific page is selected, the video will play on the page. Users can control whether the GIF opens picture-in-picture or full screen under the Video feed section in Design. Under Design in the GIF section, users can add UTM parameters to label traffic that lands on the store from a Tolstoy GIF click for tracking. Make sure to re-copy and paste the code after changing the UTM parameters.

## Email Campaigns - Product Launch

The 'Product launch' use case is designed for a single product launch campaign.

### Setting the GIF Behavior

By default, the 'Product tagged' playlist is selected, the newest product from your catalog is selected, and the GIF links to the product page. Under the Videos tab, users can switch the featured product. Under Design in the GIF section, users can change the link to a specific page on their store. Users can control whether the GIF opens the video picture-in-picture or full screen under the Video feed section in Design. Under Design in the GIF section, users can add UTM parameters to label traffic that lands on the store from a Tolstoy GIF click for tracking. Make sure to re-copy and paste the code after changing the UTM parameters.

## Email Flows - Abandonment Flows

The 'Abandonment flows' use case is a dynamic widget, creating multiple GIFs based on the product from the event properties from the email provider. Make sure the email you're adding the widget to is part of a flow triggered by a product-related event.

### Setting the GIF Behavior

By default, the 'Product tagged' playlist is selected, and the GIF links to product pages dynamically. The videos will be grouped by product featuring different GIF variations. Under Design in the GIF section, users can select a fallback playlist to populate the GIF with videos if there are less than 3 videos tagged with the featured product. Users can control whether the GIF opens picture-in-picture or full screen under the Video feed section in Design. Under Design in the GIF section, users can add UTM parameters to label traffic that lands on the store from a Tolstoy GIF click for tracking. Make sure to re-copy and paste the code after changing the UTM parameters.

## Publish

Select the email provider so we can properly track the email attribute and provide user journeys. If your email provider is not in the list, please contact support. Publishing the email widget is done using an HTML code. The code can be added via an HTML editor or via source code in a text block in a drag-and-drop editor.

Simply add the code to an email template. The GIF automatically updates with new videos from the feed set up in the project editor on the Tolstoy app. Note that the GIF won't show if there are less than three videos available.

## Klaviyo Flows

To preview the GIF for the email flows use cases, edit the template from the flow. It will show broken images instead of the videos in the GIF, which is OK. To preview properly, click 'Preview & test' and swipe through events. The GIF will show different videos per event based on the products connected to it. If you can't see the GIF, it means there were no three videos found for the GIF.
