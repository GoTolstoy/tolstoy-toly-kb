# Syncing Different Folders from Google Drive for Each Account in Tolstoy

## Current Capabilities

Currently, Tolstoy does not support the feature to sync different folders from Google Drive for each account. Users are limited to uploading individual videos or images from Google Drive.

## Uploading Media

While syncing folders is not an option, users can still upload media files such as videos and images from their Google Drive accounts. This allows for some level of integration, although it requires manual effort to select and upload each file individually.

## Feature Requests

If syncing different folders from Google Drive is a feature you would like to see in Tolstoy, consider submitting a feature request. User feedback is valuable and can influence future updates and improvements to the platform.
