## Feature Requests by Gilbert

### Media Gallery Layout

Gilbert raised a feature request for a **media gallery layout**. This feature would allow users to view media in a gallery format, enhancing the visual presentation and accessibility of media content.

### Carousel Layout Modification

In addition to the media gallery layout request, Gilbert is also working on modifying the **carousel layout** to resemble the media gallery. This modification aims to provide a more cohesive and visually appealing user experience by integrating gallery-like features into the existing carousel layout.
