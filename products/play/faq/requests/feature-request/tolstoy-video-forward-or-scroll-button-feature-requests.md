# Tolstoy Video Forward Or Scroll Button Feature Requests

Currently, Tolstoy does not support a forward or scroll button natively. This means that users cannot skip ahead or scroll through the video content. If this is a feature you would like to see, consider submitting a feature request to Tolstoy's support or development team. Your feedback can help prioritize new features and improvements.
