# UGC Search and Usage Rights Guide

## Product Overview

UGC Search allows you to search for user-generated posts on Instagram that you're tagged in or that use specific hashtags. Users can browse content they would like to use on their channels through Tolstoy. From there, they can either add it directly to the library (if they already have usage rights) or request usage rights from the creator.

## User Flow

Navigate to the UGC Search by going to Library → UGC. Users who haven't yet granted permissions for UGC search will be asked to grant permission.

## Searching for UGC

1. Once your Instagram account is connected, you can view content you're tagged in or search for specific hashtags. Your tagged content will automatically appear (under @brand_handle), and you can search for hashtags in the Search bar. Note: You are limited to 30 unique hashtag searches in a 7-day period.

2. Use filters to narrow down search results based on relevance, date, or media type (images or videos).

3. The content will include likes and comments count. Select a post to watch the video and access the content.

## Accessing Content

Once you've selected a post, you can access the content in two ways:

### Adding Content Directly to Your Library

1. If you already have usage rights for a post, click ""Add to Library.""

2. The post will be added to your main library, and you can use it across channels.

### Requesting Usage Rights

1. If you don't have usage rights, click ""Request Usage Rights"" to initiate the process.

2. A pre-written message requesting usage rights will appear. Customize the message to include specific details about how and where you plan to use the content. Tolstoy will include a link once the message is pasted for the creator to visit a landing page and approve.

3. Click ""Copy & go to post"" to open the direct message in a new tab.

4. Paste the message and send it to the creator for them to review the request.

### Managing Usage Rights

1. The post will be moved to the Pending page in Tolstoy and will be monitored for approval. Content awaiting approval will be marked as ""Pending Creator Approval.""

2. Once the creator grants permission via the buttons on the landing page, the post will be moved to the Approved page.

3. The approved post will be added to your main library and automatically tagged with the “Approved UGC” playlist.

## Tips for Efficiency

- Customize a default message for requesting usage rights in the settings to streamline the process.
- Use filters and sorting to narrow down search results based on relevance.

By following these steps, you can effectively search for UGC, request usage rights, and manage approved content in the Tolstoy app.
