## Feature Requests for Button Customization in Product Videos

### Current Functionality
Currently, there is no setting or option to change the 'back' button to a 'close' button in the product videos section. The design allows users to go back and scroll through the video feed.

### User Experience
The existing 'back' button functionality is intended to enhance user experience by allowing seamless navigation through the video feed. This design choice ensures that users can easily return to the previous screen and continue exploring other videos without interruption.

### Potential Improvements
While the current design focuses on ease of navigation, there may be scenarios where a 'close' button could be beneficial. For instance, if users prefer to exit the video section entirely rather than navigating back, a 'close' button could provide a more straightforward option.

### Conclusion
As of now, the option to change the 'back' button to a 'close' button is not available. However, feedback and feature requests are valuable for future updates and improvements. Users are encouraged to share their suggestions to help enhance the product experience.
