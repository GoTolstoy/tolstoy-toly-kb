## Feature Requests for Video Enhancements

The client has made two specific feature requests to enhance their video content:

1. **Addition of a '+' Button**: The client would like to add a '+' button to their videos, similar to the feature seen in Fenty's videos. This button could potentially be used for various interactive purposes, such as adding items to a cart or saving content for later.

2. **Manual Addition of Influencer Handles**: The client has requested the ability to manually add an influencer's handle to specific videos. This feature would allow for better attribution and promotion of influencers within the video content.

These feature requests aim to improve user engagement and provide more interactive and personalized video experiences.
