Email widget use cases
A walkthrough on how to add a carousel widget to an email.
Create
There are two types of carousel widgets, one is dynamic, suitable for email flows triggered by a product related event. The other is suitable for email campaigns showing the same content in all emails sent.

Email campaigns - Trending videos
The 'Trending videos' use case is great to add to a newsletter, product launch and even to a welcome flow. Even though it's designed for campaigns it can be used in a flow only it would show the same videos no matter what the trigger is.
Setting the GIF behaviour
By default, the 'Product tagged' and 'Trending videos' playlists are selected and the GIF links to a New TV page. Under Design in the GIF section users can change to link to a specific page on their store. If a specific page is selected the video will play on the page, users can control wether the GIF opens picture in picture or full screen under Video feed section in Design. Under Design in the GIF section users can add UTM params to label traffic that lands on the store from a Tolstoy GIF click fro tracking. Make sure to re-copy ans paste the code after changing the UTM params.

Email campaigns - Product launch
The 'Product launch' use case is desiged for a single product launch campaign.
Setting the GIF behaviour
By default, the 'Product tagged' playlist is selected, the newest product from your catalog is selected, and the GIF links to the product page. Under the Videos tab users can swith the featured product. Under Design in the GIF section users can change to link to a specific page on their store. Users can control wether the GIF opens the video picture in picture or full screen under Video feed section in Design. Under Design in the GIF section users can add UTM params to label traffic that lands on the store from a Tolstoy GIF click fro tracking. Make sure to re-copy ans paste the code after changing the UTM params.

Email flows - Abandonment flows
The 'Abandonment flows' use case is a dynamic widget, creating multiple GIFs based on the product from the event properties from the email provider. Make sure the email you're adding the widget to is part of a flow triggered by a product related event.

Publish
Select the email provider so we can properly track the email attribute and provide user journeys, if your email provider is not in the list please contact support. Publishing the email widget is done using an HTML code, the code can be added via an HTML editor or via source code in text block in a drag and drop editor.
Simply add the code to an email template, the GIF automatically updates with new videos from the feed set up in the project editor on the Tolstoy app. Notice that the GIF won't show if there are less than three videos allegeable.

Klaviyo flows
To preview the GIF for the email flows use cases, edit the template from the flow, it will show broken images instead of the videos in the GIF, it's OK. To preview properly click 'Preview & test' and swipe through events. The GIF will show different videos per event based on the products connected to it. If you can't see the GIF it means there were no three videos found for the GIF.
