# Billing Process for Tolstoy's Services

Tolstoy offers a straightforward billing process for its services. To activate an account, clients are provided with a Shopify billing link. This link is essential for the activation and must be used within 48 hours of receipt, as it expires after that period.

The cost for Tolstoy's services is **$1,750 per month**. However, new clients can take advantage of a **30-day free trial** to evaluate the services before committing to the monthly fee. This trial period allows clients to fully explore and understand the value of Tolstoy's offerings without any initial financial commitment.

In summary, the billing process involves:
1. Receiving a Shopify billing link from Tolstoy.
2. Using the link within 48 hours to activate the account.
3. Enjoying a 30-day free trial.
4. Paying $1,750 per month after the trial period ends.
