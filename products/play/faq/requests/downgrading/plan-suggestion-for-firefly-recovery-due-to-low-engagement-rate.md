# Plan Suggestion for Firefly Recovery Due to Low Engagement Rate

In response to the low engagement rate, Max suggests that Firefly Recovery should consider downgrading to the Pro plan. This recommendation is based on the observation that the current views are not exceeding the limit set by the Pro plan. By downgrading, Firefly Recovery can potentially save on costs while still meeting their current engagement needs.
