## Why my add-to-cart button just keeps on loading?

When your add-to-cart button just keeps on loading it's because the "addToCart" function is not handled, usually it's handled automatically, but there is a possibility that when the Shopify site is headless this will happen.

You can handle adding to your cart yourself using this guide: [Report Add to cart Success or Failure](https://developers.gotolstoy.com/javascript-sdk/subscriptions#report-add-to-cart-success-or-failure)
