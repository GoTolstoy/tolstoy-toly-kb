## Customization Requests for Tolstoy Integration

### Ever-Eden's Customization Requests

Ever-Eden requested the following customizations for their Tolstoy integration:

1. **Update the desktop widget**: Users should be able to close the widget by clicking outside the pop-up.
2. **Change the 'price before' color**: The color on the product card should be changed from light grey to dark grey.
3. **Move the exit cross**: On desktop stories in full screen, the exit cross should be moved from the right to the left.
4. **Reduce spacing**: The spacing between the reviews and the CTA 'Add to cart' on the product card should be reduced.
