# Supporting Client Developers with Customizations

When a client's developer is working on a customization, it is crucial for the Customer Success Manager (CSM) to offer comprehensive support. Here are some key steps a CSM should take:

## Offer Support and Availability

The CSM should make it clear to the client's developer that they are available for any questions or issues that may arise during the customization process. This ensures that the developer feels supported and can reach out whenever they encounter a problem.

## Provide Resources

Providing relevant resources can be incredibly helpful. This might include documentation, tutorials, or examples that can guide the developer through the customization process. Having these resources readily available can save time and reduce potential frustration.

## Schedule a Call

If the customization is complex or if the developer has specific needs, it may be beneficial to schedule a call. This allows for a more in-depth discussion and can help clarify any uncertainties. During the call, the CSM can address any concerns and provide tailored advice.

By following these steps, a CSM can ensure that the client's developer has the support they need to successfully complete their customization.
