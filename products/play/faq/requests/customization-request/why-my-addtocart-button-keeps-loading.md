## Why My Add-to-Cart Button Keeps Loading

When your add-to-cart button keeps loading, it's because the "addToCart" function is not handled. Usually, this function is handled automatically, but there is a possibility that this issue occurs when the Shopify site is headless.

You can handle adding to your cart yourself using this guide: [Report Add to Cart Success or Failure](https://developers.gotolstoy.com/javascript-sdk/subscriptions#report-add-to-cart-success-or-failure).

For non-developers, please reach out to support.
