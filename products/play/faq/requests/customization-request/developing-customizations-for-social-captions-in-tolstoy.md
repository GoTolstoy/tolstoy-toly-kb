# Developing Customizations for Social Captions in Tolstoy

## Introduction
Tolstoy currently does not have a built-in feature to display social captions directly. However, if you need to display social captions, custom development can be explored to add this functionality.

## Custom Development
To implement social captions, you can consider adding a custom field specifically for displaying credits. This would involve modifying the existing codebase to include a new field where social captions can be entered and displayed.

### Steps to Add Social Captions
1. **Identify the Location**: Determine where in the Tolstoy interface you want the social captions to appear.
2. **Modify the Codebase**: Update the code to include a new field for social captions. This may involve changes to the front-end and back-end components of the application.
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the new feature to ensure that the social captions are displayed correctly and do not interfere with other functionalities.
4. **Deployment**: Once testing is complete, deploy the changes to your production environment.

## Conclusion
While Tolstoy does not natively support social captions, custom development provides a pathway to add this feature. By following the steps outlined above, you can successfully implement social captions in your Tolstoy application.
