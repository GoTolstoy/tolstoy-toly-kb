# Providing Fonts for Design Updates

When working on design projects, it's crucial to ensure that all team members have access to the necessary resources, including fonts. If Roni needs the fonts to update the designs, follow these steps to provide them efficiently:

## Steps to Provide Fonts

1. **Identify the Fonts**: Determine which fonts are used in the design. This information can usually be found in the design specifications or style guide.

2. **Locate the Font Files**: Find the font files on your computer or in your organization's font library. Font files typically have extensions like `.ttf` (TrueType Font) or `.otf` (OpenType Font).

3. **Compress the Files**: To make it easier to share multiple font files, compress them into a single ZIP file. This can be done using built-in compression tools on your operating system or third-party software.

4. **Upload the ZIP File**: Use a file-sharing service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or any other preferred platform to upload the ZIP file containing the fonts.

5. **Share the Link**: Once the file is uploaded, generate a shareable link and send it to Roni. Ensure that the link has the appropriate permissions set so that Roni can download the files without any issues.

## Best Practices

- **Check Licensing**: Ensure that the fonts you are sharing are properly licensed for use by your team. Some fonts may have restrictions on distribution.
- **Provide Clear Instructions**: Along with the font files, provide clear instructions on how to install the fonts if Roni is not familiar with the process.
- **Maintain Consistency**: Make sure that all team members are using the same version of the fonts to avoid inconsistencies in the design.

By following these steps, you can ensure that Roni has the necessary fonts to update the designs accurately and efficiently.
