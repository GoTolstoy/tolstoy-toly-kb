## Customizing Your Video in Tolstoy

There are a few design tweaks available in the Tolstoy Dashboard. Navigate to Onsite, select the Tolstoy project you want to customize, and go to the Design tab. All available customizations are there.

For advanced customization, such as CSS, you need to be familiar with HTML, CSS, and Dev tools (for inspection). Inspect a Tolstoy element on your website, look for the class assigned to the Tolstoy element, use that class to create a CSS code, and add it to your website's code base. If you're not familiar with these tools, it's better to check with your dev team or have our support team help you with it.
