# First Step in the Onboarding Process

The first step in the onboarding process is to **schedule a call with the client**. This initial call is crucial as it sets the stage for the entire onboarding experience. During this call, you will discuss the client's needs, expectations, and any specific requirements they may have.

In addition to scheduling the call, it is essential to **gain access to the client's Shopify store**. Access to the Shopify store is necessary for implementation and issue resolution. This allows you to make the necessary configurations, troubleshoot any problems, and ensure that the client's store is set up correctly and efficiently.

By following these initial steps, you lay a solid foundation for a successful onboarding process, ensuring that both you and the client are aligned and ready to move forward.
