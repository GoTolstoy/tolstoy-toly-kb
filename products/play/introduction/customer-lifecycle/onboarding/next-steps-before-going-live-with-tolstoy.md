## Next Steps Before Going Live with Tolstoy

Before going live with Tolstoy, there are several important steps to ensure everything functions correctly. These steps include:

1. **Pushing the Code to a Duplicate Theme for Testing**: This allows you to test the new code in an environment that mirrors the live site without affecting the current user experience.

2. **Conducting a Final Round of Testing**: Thoroughly test all functionalities in the duplicate theme to identify and fix any issues.

3. **Pushing the Code to the Master Theme**: Once everything is confirmed to be working correctly, push the code to the master theme to go live with the changes.

Following these steps helps ensure a smooth transition and minimizes the risk of issues when the changes are implemented on the live site.
