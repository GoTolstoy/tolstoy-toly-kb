# Scheduling a Walkthrough Meeting with a Client

## Introduction

Scheduling a walkthrough meeting with a client is a crucial task for a Customer Success Manager (CSM). It ensures that both parties are aligned and can discuss important aspects of the service or product. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how a CSM should schedule such a meeting.

## Propose Available Times

The first step is to propose a few available times for the meeting. This gives the client options to choose from and increases the likelihood of finding a mutually convenient time. Make sure to offer a range of times to accommodate different time zones and schedules.

## Confirm the Client's Preferred Time

Once the client has reviewed the proposed times, they will select their preferred time. It’s important to promptly confirm this time to avoid any confusion or double-booking. Clear communication at this stage is key to ensuring that both parties are on the same page.

## Send a Calendar Invite

After confirming the client's preferred time, the next step is to send a calendar invite. This should include all necessary details such as the date, time, and a brief agenda for the meeting. The calendar invite serves as a formal confirmation and helps both parties keep track of the scheduled meeting.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, a CSM can efficiently schedule a walkthrough meeting with a client. Proposing available times, confirming the client's preferred time, and sending a calendar invite are essential actions that ensure a smooth and professional scheduling process.
