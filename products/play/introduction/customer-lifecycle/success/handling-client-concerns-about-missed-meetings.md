## Handling Client Concerns About Missed Meetings

When a client raises a concern about a missed meeting, it is crucial for a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to address the issue promptly and professionally. Here are the steps a CSM should take:

### Acknowledge the Concern

The first step is to **acknowledge the client's concern**. This shows the client that their issue is being taken seriously and that the CSM is attentive to their needs.

### Apologize Sincerely

Next, the CSM should **apologize sincerely** for the missed meeting. A genuine apology can help to mend the relationship and demonstrate that the CSM values the client's time and business.

### Provide a Solution

Finally, the CSM should **provide a solution** by offering to reschedule the meeting at a time that is convenient for the client. This proactive approach shows the client that the CSM is committed to resolving the issue and maintaining a positive relationship.

By following these steps, a CSM can effectively handle a client's concern about a missed meeting and work towards restoring their trust and satisfaction.
