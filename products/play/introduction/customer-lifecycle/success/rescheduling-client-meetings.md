# Rescheduling Client Meetings

## Acknowledging the Request
When a client requests to reschedule a meeting, the first step a Customer Success Manager (CSM) should take is to promptly acknowledge the client's request. This shows that you respect their time and are attentive to their needs.

## Confirming the New Schedule
After acknowledging the request, the CSM should work with the client to confirm a new meeting time that is convenient for both parties. Ensure that the new schedule is clearly communicated and agreed upon.

## Communicating Follow-Up Actions
Once the new meeting time is set, the CSM should communicate any additional follow-up actions that may be necessary. This could include updating calendar invites, informing other team members, and preparing any required materials for the rescheduled meeting.

By following these steps, a CSM can effectively manage meeting rescheduling requests and maintain a positive relationship with the client.
