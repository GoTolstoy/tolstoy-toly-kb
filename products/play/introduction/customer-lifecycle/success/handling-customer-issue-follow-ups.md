## Handling Customer Issue Follow-Ups

When a customer reports an issue, it is crucial to handle follow-ups promptly and professionally. The Customer Success Manager (CSM) or the relevant team member should take the following steps:

1. **Acknowledge the Issue**: Immediately acknowledge the customer's concern to show that their issue is being taken seriously.

2. **Provide a Clear Plan of Action**: Outline the steps that will be taken to address the issue. This helps in setting the customer's expectations and demonstrates a proactive approach.

3. **Suggest a Time for a Call or Meeting**: Propose a specific time for a call or meeting to discuss the issue further and work towards a resolution. This ensures that the customer feels supported and valued throughout the process.
