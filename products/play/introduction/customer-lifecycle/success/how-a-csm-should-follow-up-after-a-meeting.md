# How a CSM Should Follow Up After a Meeting

## Summarize Key Points

After a meeting, a Customer Success Manager (CSM) should start by summarizing the key points discussed. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and that there is a clear understanding of what was covered.

## Outline Next Steps

The next step is to outline the next steps. This includes detailing any actions that need to be taken, who is responsible for them, and the deadlines for these actions. This helps in maintaining momentum and ensures that tasks are completed in a timely manner.

## Ensure Pending Actions Are Completed

It's crucial to ensure that any pending actions, such as sending invites or sharing documents, are completed. This shows professionalism and helps in building trust with the client.

## Confirm Receipt of Critical Communications

Lastly, it's important to confirm the receipt of any critical communications. This can be done by asking for a confirmation email or a quick acknowledgment. This step ensures that important information has been received and understood by all parties involved.
