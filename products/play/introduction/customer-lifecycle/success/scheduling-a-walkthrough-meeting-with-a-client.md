## Scheduling a Walkthrough Meeting with a Client

When a Customer Success Manager (CSM) needs to schedule a walkthrough meeting with a client, the process should be straightforward and client-focused. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Propose Available Times**: The CSM should start by proposing a few available times for the meeting. This gives the client options to choose from and increases the likelihood of finding a mutually convenient time.

2. **Client Confirmation**: Once the client reviews the proposed times, they should confirm which time works best for them. The CSM should be flexible and accommodating to the client's schedule.

3. **Meeting Confirmation**: After the client agrees on a suitable time, the CSM should confirm the meeting. This can be done through an email or a calendar invite, ensuring all details are clear and agreed upon.

By following these steps, a CSM can efficiently schedule a walkthrough meeting that fits both their schedule and the client's, ensuring a smooth and productive session.
