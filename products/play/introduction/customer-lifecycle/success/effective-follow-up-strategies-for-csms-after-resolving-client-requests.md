## Effective Follow-Up Strategies for CSMs After Resolving Client Requests

After resolving a client's request, a Customer Success Manager (CSM) should take the following steps to ensure client satisfaction and maintain a positive relationship:

1. **Confirm Resolution**: Reach out to the client to confirm that their request has been resolved to their satisfaction. This can be done through a quick email or a phone call.

2. **Offer Further Assistance**: Let the client know that you are available for any additional help they might need. This shows that you are committed to their success and are willing to go the extra mile.

By following these steps, CSMs can ensure that clients feel supported and valued, which can lead to increased client satisfaction and loyalty.
