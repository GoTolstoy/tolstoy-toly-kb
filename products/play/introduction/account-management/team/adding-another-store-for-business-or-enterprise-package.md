## Adding Another Store for Business or Enterprise Package

If you are on the Business or Enterprise package, you can add another store. Simply download the Go Tolstoy app for your other store. If you are adding another store for the same brand but in different regions, you can download the Tolstoy app directly. For adding a totally different brand, you need to create another workspace for your store. You can also ask for help from our support team.
