## Difference Between Workspace and Folder

The workspace is essentially the **parent** environment. All folders are stored in the workspace, and when creating a new workspace, new folders will be created there as well.

Workspaces are completely separate environments from each other, and they stand alone. If you create a new workspace without your team members, they won't have access to it—even the owner—unless you invite them again to that specific workspace.
