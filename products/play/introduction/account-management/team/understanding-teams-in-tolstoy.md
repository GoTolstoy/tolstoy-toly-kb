## Understanding Teams in Tolstoy

With our team account feature, you can invite your team members into your workspace, creating a personal environment for each member to manage individually, and a team environment that's accessible to the entire team.

### Invite Team Members

The first step in establishing your team on Tolstoy is to [invite your team members to your account](https://help.gotolstoy.com/en/articles/5752903-how-to-use-team-accounts-in-tolstoy). If the member already has a Tolstoy account, they will have two workspaces: their original one and the workspace you just invited them to.

### Team Roles

Currently, there are two roles team members may have:

- **Owner**: The workspace creator. Can access all personal libraries.
- **Admin**: Added by the creator to the workspace. Has full access to the team library and their own personal library but doesn't have access to other team members' personal libraries.

**Note:** Only the account owner can gain access to the billing section.
