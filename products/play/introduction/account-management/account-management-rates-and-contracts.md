# Account Management Rates and Contracts

## Discussing Rates

When considering signing a contract, one common question is whether the rate would be lower than $500 a month. This is a valid concern and can be discussed during the meeting with Tolstoy's sales or account management team.

## Potential Discounts

Tolstoy may offer discounted rates for clients who sign a contract. However, the specifics of these discounts would need to be confirmed directly with the sales or account management team. It is advisable to bring up this topic during your meeting to get a clear understanding of the potential cost savings and contract terms.

## Next Steps

To get accurate information and discuss potential discounts, schedule a meeting with Tolstoy's sales or account management team. They will provide detailed information tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.
