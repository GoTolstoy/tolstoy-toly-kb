## How can I change the button's color in all Tolstoy videos? I can't find it in the Branding section.


For interactive videos (embed and branching widget or founder video), you can find it in Branding -> Branching CTAs. Please note that only the text color will change, not the whole CTA button. We can't change the black color in the CTA button, as we don't support its customization at the moment. This is the only customization offered for interactive videos.
