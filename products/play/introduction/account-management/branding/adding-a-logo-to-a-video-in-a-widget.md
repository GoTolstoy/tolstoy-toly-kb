## Adding a Logo to a Video in a Widget

The logo only appears on feeds (stories, carousels, TV pages, and swipeable widgets) if you add it in your profile settings under branding. It does not appear on interactive videos (branching widgets and embedded videos).

1. Go to your account profile and navigate to Settings.
2. Look for the Logo section under Branding.
3. Click Upload to choose your logo. Note that the file you upload should not exceed a resolution of 1536 pixels by 1536 pixels (width x height) and the file size should not be larger than 1 megabyte (MB).
