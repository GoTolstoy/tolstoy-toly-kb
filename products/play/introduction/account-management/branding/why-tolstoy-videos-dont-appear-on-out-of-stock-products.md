## Why Tolstoy Videos Don't Appear on Out of Stock Products

If you have the **Hide out of stock products** feature turned on, you won't see any Tolstoy videos on your out of stock or sold out products. To see Tolstoy videos even when products are out of stock, you can turn off this feature.

1. Go to Account profile
2. Go to Branding
3. Under the Feed behavior, look for Stock
4. Disable the **Hide Out of Stock products** to show products that are out of stock
