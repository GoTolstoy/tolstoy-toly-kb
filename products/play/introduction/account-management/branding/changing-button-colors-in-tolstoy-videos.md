## Changing Button Colors in Tolstoy Videos

For interactive videos (embed and branching widget or founder video), you can find the option in Branding -> Branching CTAs. Please note that only the text color will change, not the entire CTA button. We can't change the black color in the CTA button, as we don't support its customization at the moment. This is the only customization offered for interactive videos.
