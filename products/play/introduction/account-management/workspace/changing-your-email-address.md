## Changing Your Email Address

Unfortunately, we cannot change the email used in the account. However, we have two options:

1. **Downgrade your current account**: Create a new account with the correct email address.
2. **Create a new account with the correct email address**: Invite the new account as a team member on your workspace. Accept the invitation sent to the email. Change the account ownership.
