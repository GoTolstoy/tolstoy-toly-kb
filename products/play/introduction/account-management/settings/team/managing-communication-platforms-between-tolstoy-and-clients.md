## Managing Communication Platforms Between Tolstoy and Clients

When it comes to managing communication platforms between Tolstoy and its clients, there are two primary options available:

1. **Inviting Clients to Tolstoy's Slack Channel**: Tolstoy can invite clients to join their Slack channel as guests. In this scenario, Tolstoy will cover the cost associated with adding the clients as guests.

2. **Joining the Client's Preferred Communication Platform**: Alternatively, Tolstoy can join the client's preferred communication platform, such as Google Chat. This allows for flexibility and ensures that communication can take place on a platform that the client is already comfortable using.

These options provide flexibility and ensure effective communication between Tolstoy and its clients, catering to the preferences and convenience of the clients.
