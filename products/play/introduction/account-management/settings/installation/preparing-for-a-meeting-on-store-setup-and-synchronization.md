## Preparing for a Meeting on Store Setup and Synchronization

When preparing for a meeting to discuss store setup and synchronization, it is crucial to gather all relevant information about the stores. This includes:

- **Product Handles**: Ensure you have a comprehensive list of product handles that will be used in the store.
- **Current Integrations**: Document any existing integrations that the store currently utilizes. This could include payment gateways, inventory management systems, or other third-party services.
- **Specific Requirements for Synchronization**: Identify and outline any specific requirements for synchronization. This might involve data transfer protocols, frequency of updates, or particular fields that need to be synchronized.

Having this information prepared will facilitate a more productive and efficient meeting, allowing all parties to address key issues and plan effectively for the store setup and synchronization process.
