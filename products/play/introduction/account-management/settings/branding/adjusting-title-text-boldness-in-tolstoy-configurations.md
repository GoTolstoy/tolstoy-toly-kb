## Adjusting Title Text Boldness in Tolstoy Configurations

The title text boldness can be adjusted in the Tolstoy configuration settings. If you find that changes to the boldness are not reflecting as expected, it may be necessary to check the CSS on your site. In some cases, further adjustments by the development team might be required to ensure the changes take effect properly.
