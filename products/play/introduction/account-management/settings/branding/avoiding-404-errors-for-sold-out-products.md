## Avoiding 404 Errors for Sold-Out Products

To prevent 404 errors for sold-out products, customers can use a specific setting in their system. By toggling the 'Hide Out of Stock products' option, which can be found under Branding > Feed Cards > Stock, these products will be hidden from view. This ensures that customers do not encounter 404 errors when trying to access products that are no longer available.
