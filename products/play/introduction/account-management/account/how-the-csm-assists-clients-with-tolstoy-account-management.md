# How the CSM Assists Clients with Tolstoy Account Management

## Coordinating Account Organization

The Customer Success Manager (CSM) plays a crucial role in helping clients manage their Tolstoy accounts. One of the primary ways the CSM assists is by coordinating with the client to organize their account. This involves understanding the client's needs and ensuring that their account is set up in a way that maximizes efficiency and effectiveness.

## Migrating Projects to Automated Versions

Another significant aspect of the CSM's assistance is the migration of projects to automated versions. This process helps clients streamline their workflows and take advantage of Tolstoy's automation features. By migrating projects to automated versions, clients can save time and reduce the potential for human error.

## Scheduling Meetings

To facilitate these processes, the CSM has shared his calendar with the client. This allows the client to schedule a meeting at a convenient time to discuss their account organization and project migration. These meetings are essential for ensuring that the client's needs are met and that they are fully utilizing the capabilities of their Tolstoy account.
