# Information to Share with a Client Before a Meeting

## Relevant Previews
Before a meeting, it is essential to share any relevant previews with the client. This could include product demos, feature previews, or any other visual aids that will be discussed during the meeting. Providing these previews in advance allows the client to familiarize themselves with the content and come prepared with questions or feedback.

## Documentation
Sharing documentation is another crucial step. This can include user manuals, technical specifications, or any other written materials that provide detailed information about the product or service. Documentation helps the client understand the finer details and functionalities, ensuring they have a comprehensive understanding before the meeting.

## Agenda
An agenda outlines the topics that will be covered during the meeting. Sharing an agenda beforehand helps set clear expectations and ensures that both parties are aligned on the meeting's objectives. It also allows the client to prepare any specific points they want to discuss, making the meeting more productive and focused.

By sharing relevant previews, documentation, and an agenda before a meeting, a CSM can ensure that the client is well-prepared, leading to a more efficient and productive discussion.
