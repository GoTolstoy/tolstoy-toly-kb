## Understanding Copyrights and Video Usage Guidelines

We'll clarify what types of videos can be used and what should be avoided.

### Instagram (Meta)

By default, Tolstoy's Instagram integration only imports videos with music rights. This ensures the rightful usage of the content and allows the publishing of any video as is. Alternatively, if you manually upload videos from Instagram, we recommend only publishing content that you have the right to use.

### TikTok and Manual Uploads

We recommend only publishing content that you have the right to use. TikTok does not share information about music rights. Whether manually uploading or using Tolstoy's TikTok integration to automatically pull videos, we recommend only publishing content you have the right to use.

### YouTube

By default, YouTube content is free to use unless stated otherwise.
