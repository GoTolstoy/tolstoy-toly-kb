## Configuring Google Analytics 4 Tracking to Work with Tolstoy

Google Analytics 4 is an analytics service that helps you measure traffic and engagement across various platforms, like websites and apps.

Google Analytics will work as usual and show you where your traffic is coming from. We don't modify the way it works; we just give you the ability to send extra events. If you've connected Google Analytics, you can see these events in your Google Analytics account. The events will be categorized under "Event Category" with the name of the published Tolstoy, preceded by "tolstoy-". For instance, "tolstoy-Homepage" would be an example.
