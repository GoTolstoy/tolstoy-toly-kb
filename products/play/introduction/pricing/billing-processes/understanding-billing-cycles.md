## Billing Cycle

A billing cycle is the interval of time between billing statements, typically set at one month. For example, a billing cycle might run from January 1 to January 30. If you wish to cancel your plan, it is advisable to do so at the end of the billing period. This is because even if you cancel your plan on the second day of the billing cycle, it will still be canceled on the last day of the billing cycle. For instance, if you cancel on January 2, the termination will still take effect on January 30.

Upon cancellation, your account will retain all the pro features until the end of the billing cycle. For example, for a billing cycle from January 1 to January 30, if you cancel on January 2, your account will remain on PRO until February 1.
