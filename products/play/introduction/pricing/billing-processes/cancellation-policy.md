## Cancellation Policy

1. **Seamless Renewal**: Your subscription is designed to renew automatically, ensuring uninterrupted access to our services for the same period you originally selected. If you ever need to make changes, you have the flexibility to do so before the end of your current subscription period.

2. **Transparent Pricing**: If there are any changes to our fees, we'll notify you 30 days in advance, giving you plenty of time to review. If you have any concerns, you're welcome to manage your plan directly through our platform.

3. **Prorated Adjustments**: In the rare event that you decide to adjust your plan due to a fee change, we will ensure that any pre-paid fees for the unused period are fairly adjusted.
