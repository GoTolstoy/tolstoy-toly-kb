## Billing tab doesn’t show on my account

Billing tab will only show on the “Owner” account, it will not show on the “Admin” account. If you’re the one managing the Tolstoy account and need to make changes to your Billing, you can reach out to the account owner and let them know to transfer the account ownership to you.
