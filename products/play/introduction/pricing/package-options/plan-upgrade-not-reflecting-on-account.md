## Plan Upgrade Not Reflecting on Account

If the plan upgrade is not reflecting and you’re the account owner, it should automatically reflect. If it doesn't, try refreshing the page. If it still doesn't appear, I’ll connect you with our support team so they can investigate on their end.

If you’re an admin invited by the account owner, the account owner should be the one upgrading your account. You can follow up with the account owner to check if they were able to upgrade your account.
