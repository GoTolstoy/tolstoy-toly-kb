## How many videos can I upload in the free plan?

You can create up to 10 Tolstoy videos on a Free plan, but only for sharing offsite via email or SMS. You can create videos onsite, but you will not be able to publish them on your website.

Additionally, if you are a Shopify customer and your shop is eligible, you can tag videos with products to show in the Shop app without any limit.
