## Pricing Plan Differences

### Free Plan

The Free Plan allows users to share Tolstoy in email and SMS campaigns. Publishing Onsite or publishing Tolstoy on your website is not available on this plan; it is only available on the Pro plan and above. You can create videos in your Shop App, share by links, and share on social media platforms. With this plan, you can create up to 10 Tolstoys with up to 5 video parts each. The maximum video length you can upload is up to 5 minutes per part.

üí°Tip: If you want to share your videos on-site, you are encouraged to start your 14-day trial.

### Pro Plan

The starting price of our Pro plan is $19 per month. It allows you to create unlimited Tolstoys and includes 5,000 views per month. Views are the number of times your Tolstoy was displayed to unique viewers. For any views exceeding the 5,000 included in your plan, there's an additional charge of $0.010 per extra view, which equals $10 for every 1,000 additional views.

**Example:** If a customer's total impressions for the month are 45,000, the total price would be $419. 
- First 5,000 views = $0
- 40,000 additional views [40,000/1,000 = 40 * $10] = $400
- Pro plan = $19
- Total = $419

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Unique views are equivalent to your website's monthly visitors.

üí°Tip: The Pro plan is best for brands with under 30K visitors/month.

### Business Plan

Our Business plan starts at $299 per month, offering unlimited Tolstoys and 50,000 included views per month. If your views exceed the 50,000 limit, there's an extra $5 for every 1,000 additional views. This plan also features personalized onboarding, VIP support, the option to remove Tolstoy branding from your videos, and the ability to create a custom landing page.

üí°Tip: The Business plan is best for brands with 30K-100K visitors/month.

### Enterprise Plan

The Enterprise plan provides a fixed price and offers unlimited Tolstoy views, the option to remove Tolstoy branding, and the ability to create a custom landing page. This plan also features customized analytics, VIP support, a dedicated Success Manager, and regular strategy and performance analysis.
