## Understanding Tolstoy's Pricing Structure

If you're wondering why there's a big jump in price from the Pro plan at $19 to $299 for the Business plan, let's break down Tolstoy's pricing for better clarity.

### Pro Plan Basics

The Pro plan is all about usage. Here's how it works:

- **Starting Price**: It starts at $19 and gives you 5,000 views per month.
- **Usage Charges**: If you go over 5,000 views, you'll be charged an extra $0.010 for each additional view (equivalent to $10 per 1,000 views) beyond the monthly limit.

For instance, if you hit 6,000 views in a month on the Pro plan, you'll pay an extra $10 for the additional 1,000 views.

Keeping an eye on your usage and staying within the included views can help you manage your plan effectively and avoid unexpected costs. You can also check your estimated price [here](https://www.gotolstoy.com/pricing#).
