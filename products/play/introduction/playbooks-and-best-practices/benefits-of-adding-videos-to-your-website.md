Brands that add videos to their website report an increase in conversion rates, lower return rates, and longer average session times. But why?

1. **More engaging.** People love swiping through short-form videos, especially user-generated content (UGC). That’s why platforms like TikTok and Instagram are winning. On average, adding videos to your product pages will double a user’s time in session.
2. **More trustworthy.** People no longer trust text reviews. They want to see other people using the product and vouching for it. Video reviews are perfect for this.
3. **More information.** Short-form videos are an easy and fast way for shoppers to consume critical product information: How does the product look in real life? What does the product look like on someone like me? How should I use this product?
