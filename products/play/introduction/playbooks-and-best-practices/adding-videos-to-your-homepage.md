## Why Add Videos to Your Homepage?

Short-form video is an incredible medium for helping people discover and understand your products and brand because they are so easy and fun to engage with.

We see brands adding videos to their homepage for two main reasons:

1. To engage visitors and increase time on site (and SEO ranking)
2. To improve click-through rate (CTR)

## What Videos Work Best on the Homepage?

Product-related videos are great for helping visitors discover and engage with your brand. The same content used for product detail pages (PDPs) will work perfectly on your homepage. Additionally, your homepage is an excellent place to engage visitors with:

- Promotions
- Brand unique identity, founder/team, behind-the-scenes, etc.
- Frequently asked questions
