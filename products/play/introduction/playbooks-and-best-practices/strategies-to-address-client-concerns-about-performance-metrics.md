## Strategies to Address Client Concerns About Performance Metrics

If a client reports no incremental lift in add-to-carts or conversion rates, there are several strategies you can suggest to improve performance:

1. **Adding More Videos**: Increasing the number of videos can provide more opportunities to engage potential customers and drive conversions.

2. **Leveraging Social Media Content**: Utilize content from social media to create relatable and engaging videos that resonate with the target audience.

3. **Tagging and Labeling Videos**: Properly tag and label videos to ensure they are easily discoverable and relevant to the audience's interests.

4. **Using Automated Stories**: Implement automated stories to maintain a consistent and engaging narrative that can capture the audience's attention.

5. **Creating AI Videos**: Use AI-generated videos to personalize content and make it more appealing to individual viewers.

By employing these strategies, you can help clients see improvements in their add-to-cart rates and overall conversion rates.
