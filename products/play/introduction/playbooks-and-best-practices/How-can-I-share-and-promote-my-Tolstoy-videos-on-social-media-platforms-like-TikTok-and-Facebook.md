## How can I share and promote my Tolstoy videos on social media platforms like TikTok and Facebook?

You won't be able to post your Tolstoy videos directly on TikTok or Instagram. However, you can import videos from these platforms into Tolstoy. Tolstoy videos can be shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Twitter. To promote your products with Tolstoy using TikTok, you can import your TikTok videos to the Tolstoy app via the integration, create different video layouts (carousel, stories, widget, etc), and share them on your website. For Facebook, you can share Tolstoy videos via Facebook posts but not stories.
