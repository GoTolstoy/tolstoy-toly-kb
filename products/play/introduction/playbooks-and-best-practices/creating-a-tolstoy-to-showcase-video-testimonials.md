2. You can use testimonials you already have, and you can also download the video responses you received in Tolstoy by following the steps below!

All of the video responses you received will be collected in your Tolstoy Threads. Once youâ€™re done collecting, navigate to a video response you received that you would like to include in your testimonials video. Click on the video itself.

The video will now be downloaded to your computer. Do this for all of the responses you would like to include!
