## Best Practices for Increasing Direct Revenue

1. **Product Page Stories**: Automatically adding videos to every product detail page (PDP) can significantly boost your conversion rates. Videos about products, reviews, demos, and FAQs help customers make informed decisions, directly driving sales.

2. **Add More Videos**: Increasing the number of videos across your products can enhance engagement and provide more opportunities for conversion. More content means more chances to convince and convert.

3. **Leverage Additional Sources**: Pulling in videos from social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok can diversify your content and attract a broader audience. You can also add videos from platforms like YouTube, Dropbox, Google Drive, and AI videos from Synthesia, Heygen, and Studio Bunu.

By implementing these practices, you're setting up a robust framework to potentially increase revenue and reduce the risk of no sales.
