### Display Your Tolstoy in Preview Mode

### Make Your Tolstoy Start at a Specific Part

If you want your Tolstoy to begin in part 2 or 3 instead of part 1, simply add `?start=X`, where X is the part number you want to show.

This Tolstoy will now show at part 2!

### Ensure Your Viewer's Email Address is Visible in the Tolstoy Inbox

If you're sending your Tolstoy to viewers who are not registered on the site, including their email addresses in the URL you send them will ensure that their responses are saved under their email address instead of as anonymous.
