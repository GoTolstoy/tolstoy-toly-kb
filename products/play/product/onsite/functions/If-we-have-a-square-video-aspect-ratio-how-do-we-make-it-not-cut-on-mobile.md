## If we have a square video aspect ratio, how do we make it not cut on mobile?

For interactive videos - branching widgets and embedded, you can choose "fit to screen" (both arrows pointing outwards) for a perfect mobile view. Just go to Onsite > select the Tolstoy project that you want to adjust > Videos tab > on the video player preview on the right, click fit to screen.
