## Is it possible to program questions over a period of time or adjust the button's appearance time?

Yes. You can use the "button's appearance time" feature. In the Onsite tab -> click the Widget you want to adjust -> Videos tab ->  and select the clock icon (youâ€™ll see this in the video player preview on the left). Simply click on the slider and choose the time you prefer. Once done, click the green check mark to save it.
