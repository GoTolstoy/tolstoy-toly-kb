## I'm seeing a pause between each new section of our video – is there a way to have the questions pop up immediately?

Click your video -> Look for the clock icon on the Videos tab (you’ll see this in the video player preview on the left) and make sure the button’s appearance time is set to 00:00. Click the green check mark once done.
