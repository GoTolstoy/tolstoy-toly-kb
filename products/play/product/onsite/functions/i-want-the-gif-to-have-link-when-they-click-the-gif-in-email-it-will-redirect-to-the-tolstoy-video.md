## I want the GIF to have link when they click the GIF in email, it will redirect to the Tolstoy video

Yes, thatâ€™s possible for both Onsite and Offsite Tolstoy videos. Go to Onsite tab or Offsite tab > hover over the Tolstoy video you want to share > click the 3 dots > Share > click Email > and Copy code. Once you paste the code to your email distribution system like Gmail, it will automatically become a linked GIF.
