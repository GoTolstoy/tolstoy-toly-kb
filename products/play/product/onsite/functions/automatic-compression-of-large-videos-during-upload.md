## Automatic Compression of Large Videos During Upload

When you upload large videos to our system, it automatically compresses them to ensure faster upload times and to save storage space. This process helps maintain the quality of the video while reducing its file size.

### How It Works

1. **Upload Initiation**: When you start uploading a video, our system detects the file size.
2. **Compression Process**: If the video exceeds a certain size threshold, the system automatically compresses it.
3. **Quality Maintenance**: The compression algorithm is designed to preserve the video's quality as much as possible.
4. **Completion**: Once the compression is complete, the video is uploaded to our servers.

### Benefits of Automatic Compression

- **Faster Uploads**: Compressed videos upload more quickly, saving you time.
- **Storage Efficiency**: Reduced file sizes mean more efficient use of storage space.
- **Quality Preservation**: Our advanced compression techniques ensure that the video quality remains high.
