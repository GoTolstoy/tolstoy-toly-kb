## Downloading and Renaming Your Final Project

The final project isn't downloadable as a whole. For instance, if you have 5 video parts in a single Tolstoy video layout, you can only download each part individually, but not the entire video as a single file.

## Renaming Your Video

To rename the video, go to the Library, click the three dots on the upper right of the video, and choose "Rename".
