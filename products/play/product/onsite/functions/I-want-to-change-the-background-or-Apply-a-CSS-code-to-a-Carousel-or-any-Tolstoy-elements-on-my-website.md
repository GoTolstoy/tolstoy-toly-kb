## I want to change the background/Apply a CSS code to a Carousel or any Tolstoy elements on my website.

If the design that you want to tweak or edit is not available in the “Design” tab of the Tolstoy project that you want to edit, you can apply a CSS code to the specific class of the element that you want to edit. You need to be familiar with CSS, HTML and Dev Tools inspector to do this. Inspect the Tolstoy element -> find the assigned class -> use CSS code to edit the background using class.
