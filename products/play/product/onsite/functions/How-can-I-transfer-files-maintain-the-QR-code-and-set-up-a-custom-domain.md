## How can I transfer files, maintain the QR code, and set up a custom domain?

For transferring files (applies to Onsite and Offiste Tolstoy projects), click on the three dots on the upper right, then select "Move to". The QR code should remain the same after transferring the file.

To set up a custom domain (which is only for Business and Enterprise plans), add a CNAME record in your DNS provider, then send your desired URL (e.g., "player.yourdomain.com") to customer support for approval.
