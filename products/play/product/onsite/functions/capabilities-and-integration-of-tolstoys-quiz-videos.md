## Capabilities and Integration of Tolstoy's Quiz Videos

Tolstoy's quiz videos allow users to input text and send it during the quiz. You can create shoppable video quizzes that provide personalized product recommendations for your customers. When a user chooses an option, they can interact with you through a video, text, or audio response. Additionally, the chosen option can direct the user to an external link or initiate a chat with you.

To export data and integrate with other services, you can use Klaviyo to automate your lead and engagement. This can be done on the Quiz tab, where there is an option to get data automatically. To see all the supported integrations, you can visit Profile -> Integrations in the Tolstoy app.
