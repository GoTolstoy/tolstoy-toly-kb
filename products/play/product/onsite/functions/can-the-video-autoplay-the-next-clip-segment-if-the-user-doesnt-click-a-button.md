## Can the Video Autoplay the Next Clip Segment if the User Doesn't Click a Button?

The videos won't autoplay if no CTA button is clicked for interactive videos (branching widgets and embed). You may use swipeable widgets or feeds (stories, carousels, etc.) instead. For interactive (branching widget and embed), the viewers need to click a CTA button before they may be led to the next video.
