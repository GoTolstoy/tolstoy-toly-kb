## Applying CSS to Change the Background of a Carousel or Tolstoy Elements

If the design you want to tweak or edit is not available in the "Design" tab of the Tolstoy project, you can apply a CSS code to the specific class of the element you want to edit. You need to be familiar with CSS, HTML, and the Dev Tools inspector to do this. 

1. Inspect the Tolstoy element.
2. Find the assigned class.
3. Use CSS code to edit the background using the class.
