## How do I download my final project and change the name?

The final project isn't downloadable. For example, you have 5 video parts in a single Tolstoy video layout, you can only download them per part but not the entire video as a whole. 


To rename the video, go to Library, click the three dots on the upper right of the video and choose "Rename".
