### Make your Tolstoy Start at a Specific Part

Let's say you want your Tolstoy to begin in part 2 or 3 instead of part 1.

simply add ?start=X, X being the part number you want to show.

**[https://player.gotolstoy.com/7jalzuv4k9aae?start=2](https://player.gotolstoy.com/7jalzuv4k9aae?start=2)**

This Tolstoy will now show at part 2!

### Make Sure that Your Viewer's Email Address is Visible in the Tolstoy Inbox

If you're sending your Tolstoy to some viewers who are not registered to the site, putting their email addresses in the URL you send them will ensure that their responses will be saved under their email address instead of as anonymous.
