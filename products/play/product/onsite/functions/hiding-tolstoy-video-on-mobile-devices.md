## Hiding Tolstoy Video on Mobile Devices

In the Tolstoy dashboard, when you go to Onsite and click a Tolstoy project, then click "Pause," it will automatically not show on both mobile and desktop. However, you can use custom CSS code to hide the Tolstoy element container on mobile devices and only show it on desktop devices. You need to be knowledgeable about HTML, CSS, and developer tools.

1. Inspect the Tolstoy element you want to hide on a specific screen.
2. Look for the assigned class on that Tolstoy element.
3. Use the class to create a CSS code for it.
4. Apply `display: none;` for the media screen you want it to hide.

This process applies vice versa. If youâ€™re not knowledgeable about it, our support team can help.
