## Why is there a big play button covering the widget preview on mobile?

If a significant play button covers most of the widget preview on mobile, this issue occurs by default on iOS devices when the battery-saving mode is activated. Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can do to change this behavior as it's related to how iOS manages power.

**What Can You Do?**

While we can't directly control this behavior, here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:
â€‹
Disable Battery-Saving Mode: If the play button size is a significant concern, you can disable the battery-saving mode on your iOS device when viewing the widget.
Inform Your Users: If you are a developer or content provider, consider informing your users about this behavior. Encourage them to disable battery-saving mode if it significantly affects their viewing experience.
