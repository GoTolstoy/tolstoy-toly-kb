## Why is there a big play button covering the widget preview on mobile?

If a significant play button covers most of the widget preview on mobile, this issue occurs by default on iOS devices when the "Low Power Mode" is activated. Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can do to change this behavior as it's related to how iOS manages power.

### What Can You Do?

While we can't directly control this behavior, here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:
â€‹
- Disable Low Power Mode: If the play button size is a significant concern, you can disable the low power mode on your iOS device when viewing the widget.
- Inform Your Users: If you are a developer or content provider, consider informing your users about this behavior. Encourage them to disable low power mode if it significantly affects their viewing experience.
