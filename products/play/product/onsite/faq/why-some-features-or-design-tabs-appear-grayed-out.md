## Why Some Features or Design Tabs Appear Grayed Out

The reason you're seeing features in the app as grayed out is that you are on the free plan. Feel free to start your 14-day trial to explore and enjoy other features.

If you are already on a Pro plan or higher, you might be editing a Spotlight carousel. This is a version of Carousel where the design is grayed out by default. You can switch it back to the default carousel, and the design will not be grayed out anymore.
