## Creating a Video Playlist

A playlist in Tolstoy is a collection of videos that you can organize and display in a specific order. This is particularly useful for creating engaging and cohesive video experiences for your visitors. For example, you can create a playlist of product demonstration videos, customer testimonials, or any other type of content you want to showcase.

1. Navigate to your Library and click the **+ Playlist** button next to each video you'd like to include. You can either create a new playlist by typing its name or choose from existing ones. Once you've added videos to your playlist in the Library, they will automatically appear in the 'Onsite' section under the 'Videos' tab of your video layout.
