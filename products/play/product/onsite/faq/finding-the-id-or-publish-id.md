## Finding the ID or Publish ID

Two options:

1. **Tolstoy Dashboard**: Navigate to Onsite and click the Tolstoy project for which you want to get the publish ID. Click the “Published” button on the upper right and copy the publish ID (it will look something like "cwqh23o34lcrd").

2. **Tolstoy Project Settings**: Click Settings (the icon next to the Analytics button on the upper right). There, you'll find your Publish ID.
