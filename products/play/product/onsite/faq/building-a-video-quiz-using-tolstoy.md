## Building a Video Quiz Using Tolstoy

Quiz functionality is only applicable to interactive Tolstoys (Branching widget and Embed). It does not apply to feeds (e.g., Stories, Carousel, Swipeable Widget, TV Page, etc).

Follow these simple steps to learn more:

1. Firstly, build your Tolstoy quiz in the Videos tab.

2. In the Settings tab, turn on the Quiz functionality. This will open up a new Quiz tab. The settings icon is next to the Analytics button on the upper right of the screen.

3. This will open up an Add result logic page. The logic page contains all of the possible choices your viewer can make, which will redirect the user to a product or a link in the Leads To column. You can select multiple choices that should lead to the same result.

4. Now it's time to set your logic, meaning which path will lead to each result. Click on the new Add result logic and choose Link or Products to create a new result. Continue pasting results and creating logic until you're satisfied.
