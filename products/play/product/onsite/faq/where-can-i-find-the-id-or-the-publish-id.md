## Where can I find the ID or the publish ID?

Two options:

1. Tolstoy Dashboard -> Onsite -> click the Tolstoy project that you want to get the publish ID -> click the “Published” button on the upper right -> Copy the publish ID  (it will look something like "cwqh23o34lcrd").

2. In the Tolstoy project -> Click Settings (icon next to the Analytics button on the upper right). There, you'll find your Publish ID.
