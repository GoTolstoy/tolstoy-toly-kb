## Where can I find the ID or the publish ID?

Two options:

1. Tolstoy Dashboard > Onsite tab > click the Tolstoy project that you want to get the publish ID > click the “Publish” button dropdown upper right > Copy the ID  (it will look something like "6z0zpcx982ez0").

2. In the Tolstoy project > Click the gear icon next to the Analytics button >  You'll find either Tolstoy or Feed ID, which would be your Publish ID.
