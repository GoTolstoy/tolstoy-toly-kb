### Introduction

Learn how to add content creator handles to video widgets and feeds using Tolstoy. This is helpful for merchants who want to highlight the content creators making their videos or for those who have partnership deals.

### Adding Content Creator Handles to Videos

1. Access the video library in Tolstoy.
2. Select a video where you want to add the content creator's details.
3. Click on the three dots, then click on “Edit creator handle.”
4. Paste the link to the creator's handle from TikTok or Instagram.
5. Confirm the changes to save the video with the creator's handle attached.

*Please note, any videos imported from a TikTok URL will automatically have the creator handle. This can be removed in the “Edit creator handle” field.*

### Enabling Content Creator Handles in Projects

1. Go to the project where you want to display the content creator handle.
2. The handle can be displayed on the widget, within the video feed, or both.

#### To Add to the Video Feed

- Go to Design → Video Feed → Behavior → Display Creator Handle.

### Finalizing the Setup

- Any videos without added creator handles will not display any handle.
- Please note, the handles will be clickable on the Spotlight layout to direct users to their profile in a new tab. It is not clickable in the default Carousel widget or within the video feed.
