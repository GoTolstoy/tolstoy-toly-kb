## How can I download my Tolstoy thumbnail?

Before you begin: It's important to note that this feature only applies to Manual projects - Branching widgets, Embed, Tile and Offsite videos (Swipeable or Branching).

1. In Tolstoy Dashboard, go to Onsite or Offsite and choose the Tolstoy video for which you want to download the thumbnail.
