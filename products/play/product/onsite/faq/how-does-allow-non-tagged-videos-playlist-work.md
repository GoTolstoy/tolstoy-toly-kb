## How does the "Allow non tagged videos on PDPs" feature work?

The **Allow non tagged videos on PDPs** feature allows all videos that align with the selected playlists on the PDP to be included in your stories, whether they are product-tagged or not. You can see this feature in the settings (next to analytics) on the upper right.

If you don't want all the videos to show and just display the right videos on the product pages, make sure you don't use this feature. Only use the **Product Tagged** playlist on the **Videos** tab.
