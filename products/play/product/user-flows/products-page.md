## Products

The ‘Products’ page, showcases a product catalog in a grid, with each product accompanied by its tagged media assets:

- **Product Tiles:** Each product is represented by a tile that mimics Tolstoy’s Player UI, which includes:
    - A thumbnail of the associated asset.
    - A card over the bottom of the video with the product's name, and image for easy identification.
    - Above the card, over the video, there is the asset name with an icon that indicates the type of media of the asset.
    - If the product has more than 1 asset assigned a +<number of additional assets> will be added on the top right of the tile (for e.g. "+4" or "+11"), indicating more images or videos are associated with the product but are not currently displayed.
- **Add Video Placeholder:**
For products with no assets tagged to, there will be an empty tile with a dashed border and a "+" symbol in the center, labeled "Add video". This suggests a user can click here to upload a new video or create a new tagged asset for a product.
- **Progress Bar:**
At the top, there’s a progress bar indicating "Products with videos: 100%", showing the percentage of products in the catalog that have associated content.
- **Filtering and Searching:**
Above the tiles, there’s a search bar allowing users to filter or search for specific products within their catalog.

This screen is thus set up to enable users to visually manage their product catalog assets, ensuring that each item has appropriate content linked for optimal value from Tolstoy. The interface is visually clean and organized, facilitating ease of use and efficient management.
