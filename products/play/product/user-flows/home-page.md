The home screen of this platform is showcasing three popular use cases for managing and promoting online retail content:

1. **Product Page Stories:**
    - Aim: To increase conversion with product videos.
    - Content: There are placeholders for videos or images. The visible content includes a close-up of skincare products and a person likely giving a testimonial or review. This feature seems designed to display stories on product pages to give shoppers a more dynamic and engaging view of the products.
2. **Homepage Spotlight:**
    - Aim: To engage shoppers with your brand.
    - Content: This section shows lifestyle images of people in urban settings, suggesting a use case where the brand's identity and ethos can be spotlighted on the homepage through visual storytelling. This could be a feature that highlights brand campaigns, new arrivals, or featured products.
3. **Shop Videos:**
    - Aim: To get seen by 100M shoppers.
    - Content: There's a mockup of a mobile interface showing a search bar and thumbnails of what appear to be trending or suggested videos. This use case promotes the integration that Tolstoy has with Shop App, a popular shopping mobile app made by Shopify that serves over 100M shoppers. The idea here is that every video that is tagged to a product in Tolstoy, can be featured directly on the home feed of every Shop App user, potentially driving extremely high traffic to the merchant (Tolstoy customer).

Each box is visually distinct and contains images and text that suggest its purpose and benefit to the user, which in this case is likely to be engaging customers and improving sales through different forms of multimedia content.
