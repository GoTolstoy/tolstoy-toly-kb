- **Video Preview and Information:**
    - The left side of the modal shows a large thumbnail preview of the selected video, along with its title. On hover, additional details like the video length are displayed.

- **Tagging Products:**
    - The right section of the modal features a "Tag Products" interface. This allows users to link the video to specific products from their catalog. It includes:
        - A search bar to find products by name.
        - An area displaying the number of currently tagged products.
        - Buttons to either "Discard" changes or "Save" them. Users can modify the product tags and either cancel or confirm these changes.
