# Tolstoy App Features and Navigation

The Tolstoy web app allows users to import, create, and curate videos and images, using them to build feeds that can be added to their sales channels. The primary users are e-commerce managers of medium-sized e-commerce brands using Shopify.

The app's main navigation is on the right side, containing the following menu items:

1. **Store Dropdown**: For Shopify users with multiple connected stores, this allows quick switching between stores, showing different SKUs and projects.
2. **Home**: Displays recommended use cases to start with, including a short step-by-step guide.
3. **Products**: Available only for Shopify users, showing the products from the connected store with all tagged videos per product, prompting users to get videos on all their products.
4. **Library**: Features secondary navigation to filter by content source or playlist, showing a grid of videos/images with the ability to add videos to playlists and tag them with products. This tab is used for ongoing content management.
5. **Onsite**: Where users create and manage their online store widgets.
