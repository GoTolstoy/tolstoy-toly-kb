    - The integrations are grouped under **‘Integrations’ page** in the Tolstoy app, it’s accessed from the profile menu that opens when clicking on the workspace avatar on the bottom left corner of the screen. This page showcases the various integration options available. There is a set of tiles, each representing a different e-commerce or customer service platform that the main app can connect with.
    - Each tile includes:
        - The name and logo of the platform (e.g., Wix, Bigcommerce).
        - A brief description of the integration benefit, emphasizing the value and use cases of connecting it to Tolstoy’s service.
        - A "Connect" button, likely to initiate the integration process. There are various connection processes, some only include api/app key and other require signup to the integrated platform.
        - A "Show me how" link, to a help article, providing detailed instructions for setting up the integration.
    - The design uses icons, clear typography, and a mix of colors to visually separate each platform and guide the user through the process of integrating their video content and data with various service providers.
