## How to Publish Videos on the Shop App's Brand Page

Add videos to your Shop app brand page to let new users explore your products in a way that’s proven to convert better.

1. First, tag products in your videos in your Tolstoy Library.

**Important:**  
The tagging step is crucial to ensure that your store stands out and presents videos in a unique and engaging way. By not completing this tagging step, Tolstoy won't be able to showcase the videos in your Shop store.

2. Once you have tagged the products in your videos, click on the Shop section.

**Important:**  
You can only create your home page feed using videos that are already in your Tolstoy library. Click on Library to access those videos. You can add videos to your Library by importing them from Instagram, TikTok, or uploading them directly to your Library.

### Setting Shop Live

For first-time users, click Publish, which is located in the top right corner of the screen. Otherwise, click on the Sync videos button. This will launch your selected videos as a feed on your Shop's home page.

### Updating Your Feed

Easily refresh your Shop's brand page feed with new video content by adding fresh videos from your Library. To include new videos in the feed, follow the same process as above, and afterward, simply click the "Sync Videos" button located in the top right corner of the page. This action will update your feed with the recently added videos.

### Pausing Your Feed

To hide or remove the feed from your Shop brand page, simply click the orange Pause button located in the top right corner of the page. This action will conceal the feed in your Shop app while you make adjustments such as adding, removing, or reordering videos.

**Important:**  
When you're ready to relaunch the feed, click the Publish button to make your feed visible and live on your Shop's brand page.
