## How will the videos be eligible to show up on the "Popular Videos" section of the Shop homepage?

To increase your chances of being featured in the popular videos section of the Shop app, consider the following strategies:

1. Create High-Quality Content: Produce videos that are visually appealing, informative, and engaging. High-quality content is more likely to attract attention and be featured.
2. Optimize Metadata: Use relevant keywords, titles, and descriptions for your videos to improve discoverability within the app's search algorithm.
3. Consistent Posting Schedule: Regularly upload new content to keep your audience engaged and coming back for more. Consistency can help you gain traction and increase your chances of being noticed by the app's curators.
4. Promote Your Videos: Share your videos on social media platforms and other channels to increase visibility and attract more viewers. The more views and engagement your videos receive, the more likely they are to be featured.
5. Follow Community Guidelines: Ensure that your content complies with the app's community guidelines and policies. Violating these guidelines can result in your videos being removed or your account being penalized.
6. Engage with Your Audience: Respond to comments, questions, and feedback from your viewers to build a loyal following and increase engagement with your content.
7. Collaborate with Influencers: Partnering with influencers or other content creators in your niche can help expose your videos to a larger audience and increase your chances of being featured.
8. Monitor Trends: Stay updated on current trends and topics relevant to your audience, and create content that aligns with these trends. Trending topics are more likely to gain traction and be featured in the popular videos section.

Also, every video with a tagged product is sent to shop to be part of the home feed. Shop is presenting videos to users according to their interest, so videos are presented to users who will probably be interested in your product. Once the user enters the video feed we are presenting more videos of products he would like according to our recommendations engine.

Videos are ranked based on their social media performance (number of views and likes) and based on their Tolstoy performance (timed watched).
