## How to check if my videos are live on the Shop app?

If you’re a Shopify customer and Shop eligible, click the “Shop” tab in the Tolstoy Dashboard -> Start Creating -> then just Publish or click the Sync videos button on the upper right for both Shop Home page/Brand page and Shop product pages.


After you publish, go to the Shop mobile app and search for your store, videos on the brand/home page should automatically show, as well as the videos on the product pages that have videos tagged.
