## Why the Shop Button is Not Working

The SHOP button will only appear on the Tolstoy dashboard if you're eligible and integrated with Shopify. To integrate with Shopify, please click your profile letter on the lower left, then go to Integrations and select Connect Shopify. Once done, the SHOP section/button should appear on the left panel of your Tolstoy dashboard.
