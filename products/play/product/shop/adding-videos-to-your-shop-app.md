- For the Shop Brand page or Home page, you need to manually add a video or videos.
- For the Shop Product page, you need to tag videos with products in your library section first, and they will automatically sync on the Shop Product page section.

**Important:** Thereâ€™s no need to upgrade to a Pro plan or higher if you want to add videos to your Shop app.
