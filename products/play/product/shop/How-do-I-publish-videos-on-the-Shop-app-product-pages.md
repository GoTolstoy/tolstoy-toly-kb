### Updating your feed

You can easily update your Shop product pages feed with new video content by adding fresh videos from your Tolstoy video library.

- First, you need to return to your video library to complete the following actions:
  - Tag videos from the video library with new or additional products.
  - Untag videos that you don’t want to show in your product pages feed.
- When you’re finished tagging or untagging videos, simply click the Sync Videos button located in the top right corner of the page. This action will update your feed with the recently added or removed videos.

**Remember!**
Anytime you tag a product in a Tolstoy video, that video will also appear next to your products on Shop after you sync your videos.
Also, whenever you make any changes to your product page feeds, you must click Sync Videos so the updates can be implemented into the feeds.

### Pausing your feed

To hide or remove the feed from your Shop product page, simply click the orange Pause button located in the top right corner of the page. This action will conceal the feed in your Shop while you make adjustments such as adding or removing videos.

**Important:**
When you're ready to relaunch the feed, click the Publish button to make your feed visible and live in your Shop PDPs. Also, our videos only appear on the **SHOP mobile app**. They are not shown on SHOP app browser site.
