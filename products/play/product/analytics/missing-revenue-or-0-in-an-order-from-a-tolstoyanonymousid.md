## Missing Revenue or $0 in an Order from a tolstoyAnonymousID

The **tolstoyAnonymousID** serves as an identifier to track whether a user has interacted with your video content. Importantly, this identifier is not related to the processing of orders. If you're looking to see how long a user engaged with your video, refer to the **Time on Tolstoy** metric.

If you encounter an order with a $0 amount and the tolstoyAnonymousID is associated with it, this typically indicates that no revenue was captured for that order. This could include in-video revenue, post-video revenue, or indirect revenue. Such an order may appear as a line item in the cart but fails to generate revenue due to issues within your internal workflow.

To resolve this, we recommend reviewing your internal processes to identify any potential issues. If the problem persists, please contact support for further assistance.
