## Missing Revenue or $0 in an Order from a TolstoyAnonymousID

The **tolstoyAnonymousID** is a unique identifier used to track user interactions with your video content. If you want to know how long a user watched your video, refer to the **Time on Tolstoy** metric. However, it's important to note that this identifier is not connected to the processing of orders or revenue capture.

If you notice an order with a $0 amount linked to a tolstoyAnonymousID, it usually means that no revenue was generated for that order. This includes in-video purchases, post-video purchases, or any indirect revenue. The order may appear in the cart as a line item, but it does not contribute to your revenue totals.

While there are various reasons why revenue might be missing, it could be due to issues within your internal workflow. To resolve this, we recommend reviewing your internal processes. Begin by thoroughly examining your internal workflow to identify any potential issues that could be causing the revenue discrepancy. If the problem persists, please contact support for further assistance.
