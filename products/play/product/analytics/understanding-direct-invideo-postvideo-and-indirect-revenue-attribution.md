# Understanding Direct, In-Video, Post-Video, and Indirect Revenue Attribution

## Revenue Types

### Direct Revenue

Direct revenue generated by Tolstoy can be attributed in two ways: In-Video and Post-Video purchases.

- **In-Video Purchase**: Products purchased after being added to the cart inside a video.
- **Post-Video Purchase**: Products purchased after being seen inside a video.

### Indirect Revenue

Revenue from anyone who interacted with Tolstoy but didn't make a direct purchase.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multiple Video Engagement with Same Product

**Situation**: A customer watches two videos (Video A and Video B), both featuring the same product, and later makes a purchase.

**Revenue Attribution**: Video A and Video B are both attributed the full product revenue (e.g., $50 each) in the Videos tab. However, in the Overview tab, only one instance of the total $50 revenue is reflected to prevent double counting.

### Scenario 2: In-Video Purchase

**Situation**: A customer watches a video (Video C) featuring Product Y, adds it to their cart directly within the video, and completes the purchase.

**Revenue Attribution**: Video C is attributed the full product revenue in both the Videos tab and Overview tab since the purchase was made directly through the video (In-Video purchase).

### Scenario 3: Post-Video Purchase

**Situation**: A customer watches a video (Video D) showcasing Product Z but exits the video without making an immediate purchase. Later, the customer returns to the website and purchases Product Z through a standard checkout.

**Revenue Attribution**: Video D is attributed the full revenue of Product Z in the Videos tab because it influenced the purchase (Post-Video Purchase). The Overview tab reflects the revenue as part of the overall total, but only once.

### Scenario 4: Indirect Revenue

**Situation**: A customer watches a Tolstoy video (Video E), interacts with the content but does not make a direct purchase. Several days later, they purchase the featured product on site.

**Revenue Attribution**: Video E may not show any direct revenue in the Videos tab, but the interaction still contributes to Indirect revenue. Indirect revenue data can be used for insights into brand awareness or customer engagement. The Overview tab will show the revenue from this interaction in the 'Indirect Revenue' section under the total revenue.
