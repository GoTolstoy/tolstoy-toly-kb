## How Views Are Counted for Tolstoy Videos

A view is counted the moment a Tolstoy is displayed to unique visitors. It is the number of unique users that land on a page containing a Tolstoy. For example, if a user lands on your website with a Tolstoy widget on it, whether played or not, it will be counted as a view. If the same user lands on the same page multiple times, it will only be counted as one view because it is per unique user.

You can check the views count for all your Tolstoy videos under Account Level Analytics > Engagement > Unique Views. You can also filter the days on the top right. The unique views count will reset after the free trial.
