# Understanding Tolstoy Analytics

When reviewing analytics for Tolstoy implementations, it's crucial to understand the different metrics and benchmarks for various placements on an e-commerce website. This guide will help you interpret the data and optimize performance for different Tolstoy features.

## Homepage Implementations

### Homepage Spotlight

- **Primary metrics**: Click-through rate (CTR) and average video watched
- **Purpose**: Product discovery and brand identity
- **Note**: Not expected to directly impact conversion rates

### Homepage Carousel (Default)

- **Primary metrics**: Engagement rate and average video watched
- **Best for**: Reviews and user-generated content (UGC)
- **Placement**: Recommended below the fold, after brand introduction

### Discover Feed

## Product Page Implementations
