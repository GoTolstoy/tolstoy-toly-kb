Now when a user clicks on the chat option, it will open up your Gorgias live chat! 
You are all set! As long as you have Gorgias installed on your site, then you're good to go. Users can click on the button, which will automatically open up the live chat.
Note:  Make sure not to set the Gorgias as hidden so it opens from our app.
