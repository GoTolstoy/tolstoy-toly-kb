## Integrating Zapier with Tolstoy

Zapier lets you connect your Tolstoy to hundreds of other web services! You can easily create "Zaps" by defining Triggers and Actions, so the data you collect from your Tolstoy is sent automatically to wherever you choose (e.g., Slack, Gmail, Google Sheets, etc.).

1. First, go to your Zapier account and create a New Zap.
