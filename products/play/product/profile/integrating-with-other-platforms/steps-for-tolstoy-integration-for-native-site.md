### Step 1 - Adding the JavaScript script code
Integrating your store frontend includes placing Tolstoy’s core scripts and widgets in your storefront. Javascript is required so the widgets function can be displayed on your site. 

 

Once you are logged into your Tolstoy account, you can continue with the installation by clicking this [link](https://app.gotolstoy.com/account/installation). You can also use the following instructions to complete your manual installation for Tolstoy.

4. Add the copied code to the `<head>` tag in your store.

**Tip**: Keep your Tolstoy Settings open (seen in the picture below) in a separate tab or window from your ecommerce store. You’ll need to complete the set up of conversion tracking, which has instructions after number 4 below.

5. Once you have successfully added the JavaScript code to the `<head>` section of your website, please click the 'Complete' button to finalize the setup. In the screenshot below, I’ve already clicked the ‘Complete’ button, so it now shows ‘Completed’ and is grayed out.

### Step 2 - Setting up conversion tracking
Tolstoy helps you engage your customers to drive traffic to your store, and boost your sales with its interactive and shoppable platform. The conversion tracking code enables you to measure those gains.

 

Following each successful checkout submission, Tolstoy validates if the visit and sale were generated by Tolstoy or self-served. 

 

Step 2 is essential for tracking the conversion analytics of Tolstoy. You can locate the conversion tracking code within your Tolstoy account. You can find the code by clicking [here](https://app.gotolstoy.com/account/installation) or continue by following the instructions below.

**Important:**

Before moving on to the next step, ensure that you have successfully completed the JavaScript installation by clicking the 'Complete' button.

6. After you’ve completed the steps above, click on **Step 2 Conversion Code** in your **Installation** screen.

7. Click on the **Copy Code** button.


8. Place this conversion code on your store's order confirmation page (also known as the Order Thank You page).
 

9. Ensure the conversion tracking code is loaded at the completion of each purchase, on the **order confirmation** page of your store.
 
**Important:**

When you add the code above to your purchase thank you page, make sure to replace all of the **mandatory fields in red to personalize your code.** 

 

Some mandatory fields include the **ORDER_ID, TOTAL_PRICE, USER_EMAIL, and ORDER_CURRENCY.**

 

A complete list of mandatory fields is in the table below and you need to replace portions of the code with the **correct placeholders**
