## Connecting Tolstoy to Instagram

Instagram Graph API can be used only by “Instagram Professional accounts” ([Instagram Help](https://help.instagram.com/138925576505882)). This includes Business accounts (intended for companies) and Creator accounts (intended for individuals, like influencers).

**Requirements:**

- A Facebook account (can be your personal account)
- A Facebook page – ideally a dedicated testing page, so create one now ([Create a Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/))
- An Instagram account – ideally a dedicated account for testing (sign up for one [here](https://www.instagram.com/))

**How to accept Graph API calls:**

1. **Step 1** - Log into your Instagram account and go to account settings. Here, click “Switch to professional account”.

2. You have two options: Creator and Business. Select Business, pick a category (can be anything), and skip the step to add contact information.
3. Go to your Facebook page's settings. On the “Professional dashboard,” select “Linked Accounts”.
