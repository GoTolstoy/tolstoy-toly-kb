## Adding Tolstoy to Your Website

Add the Tolstoy script to the header of your website (inside the `<head>` tag).

Once done, you can create a Tolstoy project based on your preference in the Tolstoy Dashboard. Navigate to the Onsite tab. When it comes to installing the Tolstoy project that you created, you need to use the code for that Tolstoy project. Click on "Publish" in the upper right corner, then click "Use code instead." Copy the code and paste it into the backend of your website where you want the Tolstoy video to show.
