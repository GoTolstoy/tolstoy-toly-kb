## How to Delete Instagram Data

Connecting Instagram to Tolstoy allows you to import your video content from Instagram and use it in your video experiences on and off site.

If you decide to remove the integration and want to delete all your imported data as well, you can contact our support using the chat at the right-side corner or send an email to [support@gotolstoy.com](mailto:support@gotolstoy.com).

After requesting to delete this content, your data will be removed within 7 days. You can follow up on your ticket to ask about the request status.
