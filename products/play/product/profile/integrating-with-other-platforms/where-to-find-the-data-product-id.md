## where to find the data-product-id

if you're looking for this specific product ID, it typically refers to the unique identifier for a product within your e-commerce platform (for example, Shopify, Wix, or another platform where your store is hosted).

To find the actual product ID to use in place of PRODUCT_ID:

For Shopify:

Go to your Shopify Admin dashboard.
Click on "Products" to view your product list.
Click on the product you want to link.
In the URL of your browser while viewing the product, the number at the end after /products/ is the product ID.
For Other Platforms:

The method is similar: look for the product in your platform's product management section and use the unique identifier given in the URL or product details section. Usually this can be found in your website.
