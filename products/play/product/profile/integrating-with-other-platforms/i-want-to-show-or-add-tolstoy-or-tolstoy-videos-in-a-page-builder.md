## I want to show or add Tolstoy or Tolstoy videos in a Page Builder, like Replo, GemPages, PageFly, Zipify, Shogun etc.

If you want to display Carousel or Stories in a Page Builder. You can go to Onsite tab > select the Tolstoy project that you created > click the publish button (top right) > click “Use code instead” > copy code.

Paste it in the page builder using their Custom HTML block or Custom liquid block. If you’re not familiar with it, here are the Help Center articles for them:
