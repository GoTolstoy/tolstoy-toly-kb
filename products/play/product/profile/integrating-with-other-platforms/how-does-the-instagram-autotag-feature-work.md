## How does the Instagram Autotag feature work?

The Autotag feature automatically tags products in Tolstoy videos for connected Instagram accounts, using the products tagged with Instagram Shopping tags.

### Here's how to set it up:

1. Go to Library -> Instagram -> Click the **Settings** icon.

2. **a. Autotag**

   You can choose to enable "Automatically sync product tags on your videos with Instagram Shopping tags," or "Sync Instagram Shopping tags to videos that have 
   already been tagged." You may also enable both options.

  **â€‹b. Imported content**

  Tolstoy automatically imports all content from 90 days before you connected. All previous content can be loaded and reviewed from the "Instagram" tab and will be 
  imported once tagged with a product or playlist. If you choose to enable it, you have an option to choose form 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 2 years, or All time.
