## How does the Instagram Autotag feature work?

The Autotag feature automatically tags products in Tolstoy videos for connected Instagram accounts, using the products tagged with Instagram Shopping tags.

### Here's how to set it up:

1. Go to **Library** -> Hover over **Instagram** -> Click the **Settings** icon on its right.

   â€‹b. **Imported all Instagram content**

   Tolstoy automatically imports all content from 90 days before you connected. All previous content can be loaded and reviewed from the "Instagram" tab and will 
   be imported once tagged with a product or playlist. You also have the option to choose from 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 2 years, or All time.
