Now, when a user clicks on the chat option, it will open up your Gorgias live chat! You are all set! As long as you have Gorgias installed on your site, users can click on the button, which will automatically open up the live chat.

**Note:** Make sure not to set Gorgias as hidden so it opens from our app.
