## HeyGen Integration

This KB is for users who have come from HeyGen and have downloaded Tolstoy via the HeyGen integrations page.

1. User is assumed to have come from HeyGen, and the integration is specific to them.
2. User created their account from the HeyGen Integrations page, which takes them to the Tolstoy app listing, which they need to download and then create a Tolstoy account. By the time they would be interacting with Toly, they would be past these steps.

## What is HeyGen?

HeyGen is an online tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create videos with talking avatars and voiceovers.

Users can create avatars that mimic their speech and physical appearance, and then type a script to create a video. HeyGen can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Sales outreach: Create personalized videos
- Content marketing: Create videos to add to your content calendar
- Product marketing: Create engaging videos for products
- Learning and development: Create training videos

## Landing in the Tolstoy app after creating the account

1. First, the user will have to click through 4 screens as an intro the Tolstoy (the user can click out of any of these screens to skip the intro).
    
2. Then, the user will land on the Home page, which has Set Up prompts at the top and popular use cases below that.
    
3. The initial setup is slightly different for Shopify users vs non-Shopify users.
    1. Shopify: Shopify users have 2 setup prompts: “Connect your Shopify store to Tolstoy” and “Connect your video sources.” 
        1. “Connect your Shopify store to Tolstoy” - This comes with a description to the user saying “Connect Shopify with Tolstoy to access your product catalogue and manage your on-site videos. Don't worry, this won't add anything to your site.” and it also has a button that says “Connect your Shopify store” — clicking on this button brings the user to Tolstoy’s app listing on the Shopify app store. The action will be marked as completed with a green check once Tolstoy has been downloaded onto the Shopify store. Once this is complete, the user can navigate to the Products tab to see their product listings from Shopify.
        
            
        2. “Connect your video sources.” - This comes with a description to the user saying “Once your video source is connected, your videos will be ready to use in Tolstoy in real time.” and it also has options to connect HeyGen, as well as Optional options to connect TikTok and Instagram. To connect HeyGen, click on the “Connect” button and then it will go to this page below. Click on “Authorize” to complete the HeyGen integration. The action will be marked as completed with a green check once HeyGen has been integrated into Tolstoy. Once this is complete, the user can navigate to the Library tab to see their HeyGen videos.
            
    2. Non-Shopify: Non-Shopify users have 1 setup prompt: “Connect your video sources.” It is identical to the description above.
4. Once the setup steps are complete, the user will see that the setup has been completed.
    
    1. The user should get started with a popular use case, like the Hompage spotlight, Avatar bubble, or Basic AI Video.
        1. Homepage Spotlight: It is important to emphasize the value of the Homepage spotlight to a new HeyGen user, which is that it showcases your videos in a prominent way, and is a great option for homepages or landing pages for product launches, How-To’s, trending videos, etc.
            1. The user will see this screen when clicking on the Homepage spotlight use case, explaining that adding videos to the Homepage playlist is a convenient way to select videos for the spotlight. 
    
                
                1. If the user clicks to the next screen without adding any videos to the playlist, they’ll see this screen, which says that no videos were found in the playlist.
                    
                    
            2. After adding videos to the Homepage playlist and clicking next, the user will be prompted to review the videos that were added to this playlist, with a note saying this can be customized later.
                
            3. The user will be taken to the spotlight project page, which is exactly like any other spotlight project in Tolstoy, and all designs and customizations and publishing instructions can reference your existing knowledge of that use case.
        2. Avatar Bubble: It is important to emphasize the value of the Avatar Bubble to a new HeyGen user, which is that it lets customers interact with your brand in a dynamic way and/or to learn more about your products through a dynamic video journey.
            1. The initial setup for the Avatar Bubble is identical to that of the Homepage Spotlight flow above, with the user being prompted to add the videos to playlists. The user will then be taken to the bubble project page, which is exactly like any other Founder video project in Tolstoy, and all designs and customizations and publishing instructions can reference your existing knowledge of that use case.
        3. Basic AI Video: This allows the user to publish a single video, and gives the user the ability to customize the way that it will be displayed onsite. This video can be used to collect form responses, which will be displayed in the Responses tab of the project. 
            1. The user will see this screen when clicking on the Basic AI Video use case, prompting the user to pick a video that will be used for this project.
                
            2. The user will then be taken to the Basic AI Video project page, which is exactly like any other Embed project in Tolstoy, and all designs and customizations and publishing instructions can reference your existing knowledge of that use case.

## Publishing Projects in Tolstoy

Unlike regular Tolstoy users, HeyGen users are able to publish projects onsite for free. The caveat is that they are only able to publish HeyGen videos (which are all AI videos), and not videos from any other sources that one would typically integrate into Tolstoy. In terms of how this is managed, the user can publish any project that they want, but the only videos that will appear onsite are videos that are integrated via HeyGen. 

Examples:

1. If a user creates a spotlight project using all HeyGen videos, they can publish this project and all videos will appear.
2. If a user creates a spotlight project with 10 HeyGen videos and 3 Instagram videos, they can still publish the project, but the Instagram videos will be treated as Hidden and will not actually appear onsite.
3. If a user creates a project without any HeyGen videos and using other video sources, they will be able to publish the project but none of their videos will appear.

If a user has trouble seeing their videos onsite, it could be the case that they are trying to publish non-HeyGen videos. If they are confident that HeyGen videos are not appearing, make sure that their HeyGen videos have been uploaded via the HeyGen connection, and not downloaded from HeyGen and then re-uploaded.
