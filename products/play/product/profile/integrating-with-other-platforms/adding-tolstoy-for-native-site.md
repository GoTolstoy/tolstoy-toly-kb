## Adding Tolstoy for Native Site 

Add the Tolstoy Script first to the header of your website (inside <head> tag). 

Once done, you can create a Tolstoy project based on your preference in the Tolstoy Dashboard > Onsite tab > when it comes to installing the Tolstoy project that you created, you need to use the code for that Tolstoy project (click on Publish upper right, click “Use code instead”, Copy code) and paste it to the backend of your website where you want the Tolstoy video to show.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c51a2e7f-54fa-45f3-84e9-ee340a78ad3a)
