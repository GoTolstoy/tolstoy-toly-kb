## How to share Tolstoy through Yotpo email

Increase engagement, add dynamics, and boost sales by adding Tolstoyâ€™s Shoppable videos to your email campaigns.

**Before you begin:**

There are three types of videos that you can share:
1. Swipeable - (Shoppable video feed) transform your videos into a dynamic shopping experience by tagging products.
2. Branching - (Interactive video) creating videos that include Calls-To-Action (CTAs). Guide your audience through a personalized journey by enabling them to make choices within the video.
3. A single video - for a straightforward approach, select the Branching format and upload a single video.

Here are the steps:

1. Go to Offsite - > Click New Tolstoy -> Choose between Swipeable or Branching. ![Step 1](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/979221906/8bab7ac578036bf6c22ff97d/image.png)
