There are two types of widgets: branching and swipeable. Both can be either onsite or offsite.

## Swipeable Widgets

Swipeable widgets mimic TikTok’s feed and show videos with vertical swiping. Users can tag videos with products, and the feed displays them with the video. On mobile, the feed’s player takes up the entire screen, showing products on the video. On desktop, there are two options available: full screen (showing products on a panel on the right) or picture-in-picture (showing products like on mobile).

There are two types of feeds: manual and automated. The manual feed is less popular as it allows users to select specific videos and add custom descriptions and links to each video. However, it is hard to maintain and does not support all features. The automated feed showcases videos matching playlists dynamically, meaning it adds videos matching the playlist automatically to the feed and dynamically displays videos on PDPs by the products tagged.

There are two top tabs available on the feed: "For You", showing the feed’s selected videos by the app settings, and "Wishlist", showing saved products. The feed has two main screens: the video and the product card. The product card mimics the product page or the cart in the case of multiple products tagged. It allows users to add to the cart or proceed to the store's checkout.

## Branching Widgets

Branching widgets feature videos with call-to-actions, either navigating viewers within the videos, navigating to a URL, or collecting responses. This is only available with onsite’s bubble, embed, or offsite.
