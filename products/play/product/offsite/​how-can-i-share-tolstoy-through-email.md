## ​How can I share Tolstoy through email?

Increase engagement, add dynamics, and boost sales by adding Tolstoy’s Shoppable videos to your email campaigns.

**Before you begin:**

There are three types of videos that you can share:
1. Swipeable - (Shoppable video feed) transform your videos into a dynamic shopping experience by tagging products.
2. Branching - (Interactive video) creating videos that include Calls-To-Action (CTAs). Guide your audience through a personalized journey by enabling them to make choices within the video.
3. A single video - for a straightforward approach, select the Branching format and upload a single video.

Here are the steps:

1. Go to Offsite - > Click New Tolstoy -> Choose between Swipeable or Branching. ![Step 1](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/979221906/8bab7ac578036bf6c22ff97d/image.png)

### Centering your Tolstoy Gif

If for some reason you're struggling to center your Tolstoy within the email, you can use this code snippet:

```html
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr>
<td align="center" class="col" width="600">
<div class="col_content">
<!-- PASTE YOUR EMAIL CODE HERE -->
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
