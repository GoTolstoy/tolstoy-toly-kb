# Adding Videos to Emails

When adding videos to your emails, it's important to consider the type of video content you want to include. Are the videos specific to a product or general, and is this for a one-time campaign or an ongoing flow? Here’s how you can add the right kind of video depending on your needs.

## Types of Videos to Add in Emails

### Abandonment Flows

Use this for product-specific flows, such as cart or browse abandonment. Videos in these flows are automatically tailored to display content related to the specific products viewed or left behind by the customer.

### Trending Videos

Ideal for non-product-specific email campaigns, this option allows you to feature your brand’s most engaging and popular content. The videos are refreshed automatically, with AI selecting the top-performing videos to captivate your audience.

### Product Launch

For a product-specific campaign, this option is perfect for showcasing videos that highlight a new product. Use these videos to build excitement, demonstrate the product in use, and provide social proof to encourage purchases.
