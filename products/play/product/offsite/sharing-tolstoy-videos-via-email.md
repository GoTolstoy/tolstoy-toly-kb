## How to Share Tolstoy Videos via Email

Increase engagement, add dynamics, and boost sales by adding Tolstoyâ€™s Shoppable videos to your email campaigns.

**Before you begin:**

There are three types of videos that you can share:

1. **Swipeable** - Transform your videos into a dynamic shopping experience by tagging products.
2. **Branching** - Create interactive videos that include Calls-To-Action (CTAs). Guide your audience through a personalized journey by enabling them to make choices within the video.
3. **Single Video** - For a straightforward approach, select the Branching format and upload a single video.

### Steps to Share Tolstoy Videos

<tr>
<td align="center" class="col" width="600">
<div class="col_content">
