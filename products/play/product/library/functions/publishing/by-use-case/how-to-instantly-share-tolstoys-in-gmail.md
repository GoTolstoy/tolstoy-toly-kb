4. You can choose one from your library or record a Tolstoy on the spot.  
   ![Choose Tolstoy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e9b891f-e5c0-4412-befc-a3885bdba7a8)
5. If you choose your library, you will see all of the Tolstoys in your account. Pick the one you'd like to send - you can also search by name!  
   ![Library](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16b8a7d2-b210-41b1-9811-ce71fbe765e3)

The Tolstoy you chose will appear in the email as a hyperlinked gif and will be ready to send.

If you choose to record one on the spot, this will trigger the extension, enabling you to record your face only, your screen + face, or just screen. The Tolstoy will then be saved in your account library, and you can share it following the steps above.
