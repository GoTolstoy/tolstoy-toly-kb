### Configuring Tolstoy for Feed Implementation

The feed can be implemented either from the **Homefeed Top Bar** or via **Navigation Item**. Please note, only Tapcart users on an Enterprise plan can use the Navigation item implementation.

1. Choose if it's a home page top bar or navigation item, and then click **Done**.

**Note:** If your Tapcart app uses multi-currency, go to the **Design** tab and turn off **Product price** under the **Product Card** section.
