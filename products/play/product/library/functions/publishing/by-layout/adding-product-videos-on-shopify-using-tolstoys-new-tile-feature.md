## Tutorial Video

### Introduction

In this article, we'll guide you through the process of using Tolstoy's new tile feature to dynamically add a product video to your Shopify product pages (PDPs). The tile feature allows you to insert a single block into your template that automatically displays the respective product videos on all your product pages.

### Prerequisites

You should have some videos tagged with products in your Tolstoy account.

### Steps

#### 1. Creating a New Tile Project

- Go to "onsite" then click "create Tolstoy" > Select the "Tile" layout then click "start creating"

#### 2. Selecting Product Videos

- In the project, navigate to the "Videos" section. You'll see a list of products that have associated product videos.

##### Pinning Specific Videos (Optional)

If you want to display a specific video for a product, click on the product and pin the desired video as the first video and save changes. If you don't pin any videos, each time a user reloads the page, they will be shown one of the product videos, chosen at random.

##### Customizing Design (Optional)

- Go to the "Design" section in the project.
- Adjust the padding as desired.
- Choose to show video controls if needed (e.g., play button, full screen).
- Customize the play button with a border and control the transparency.
- Save your design changes.

#### 3. Publishing the Tile

- Once your design is ready, go to the "Publish Instructions" section.
- Copy the "Publish ID" provided and click "Add block". This will guide you to your product template and add a block.
- Add the publish ID to that block and hit save. Any product that has tagged videos will have a video tile appear.

### Analytics

Analytics on users who watched the Tile video are available in the "Analytics" tab of Tolstoy. You can drill down on the project level to see analytics related to the Tile project only.

You can adjust the tile position and experiment with where you want it to be shown based on your desired design.
