## Tapcart Block Editor

For the Tapcart Block Editor, there are different approaches when considering the type of implementation and navigation. You can use this guide to see which navigation and what implementation you'll need.

### Comparison of Navigation Item and Homefeed Top Bar Implementation

Navigation items at the bottom provide quick, direct access to app sections, reducing navigation steps. In contrast, the Homefeed top bar offers a streamlined way to filter or switch content within the home screen, keeping the user's focus on the primary content while maintaining quick accessibility.

### Comparison of Bottom Navigation and Side Navigation

Bottom navigation is preferred for apps requiring frequent access to core features, enhancing usability with prominent, easily accessible icons. Side navigation, however, is better for apps with numerous options, maintaining a cleaner main screen but necessitating more taps to reach content.
