## I want the widget/popup to only show on the Homepage or specific pages

You need to set up a Rules for that. 

1. In the Onsite tab, select the widget that you want to only show on the **homepage** and hide on all other pages.

2. Go to the Rules tab -> Add rule -> select **Equals to** then paste the URL of your homepage. This applies vice versa, homepage or other specific pages.
