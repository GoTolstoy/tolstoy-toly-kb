6. The condition will be 'Product tagged' by default.
   **Note**: Videos will show here if you tag a product to a video in the Tolstoy Dashboard > Videos tab. If you’re non-Shopify, you can add a CSV file for your products. If you’re using Shopify, your products are automatically synced in Tolstoy.

Once you have created the Stories (for Product pages or any other pages), you will be redirected to its own dashboard. 

**Remember**: If you create a layout/feature, not just Stories but for all types of layouts/features in the Onsite tab, we call that a “Project,” and each project has its own dashboard. This is where you can manage the Videos, Design, and the Analytics of that project you created.
