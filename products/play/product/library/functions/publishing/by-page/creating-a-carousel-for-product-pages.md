    ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Once you create the Carousel, it will automatically have a set playlist of "Product tagged". This means that all videos with tagged products will show in the carousel you created (you can tag videos with products in the "Library" tab). You can set up custom Playlist (by labeling videos with the playlist name) and if you select this playlist in the carousel that you created, videos with the selected labels will show in the carousel.
