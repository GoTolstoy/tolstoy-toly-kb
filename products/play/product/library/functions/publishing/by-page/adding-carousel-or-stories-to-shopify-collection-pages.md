   💡**Tip:** Once you create the Carousel or Stories, it will automatically have a set playlist of “Product tagged.” This means that all videos with tagged products will show in the carousel or stories that you created (you can tag videos with products in the “Videos” tab).

6. Click Publish when ready.
