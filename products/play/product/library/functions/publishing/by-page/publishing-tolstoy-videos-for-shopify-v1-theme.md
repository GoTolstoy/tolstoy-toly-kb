3. Find the file of the page where you want to add the Tolstoy video. If youâ€™re adding it to a product page, the file name is usually `product-template.liquid`. If you are unsure, you may need to ask for help from your development team.

4. Once you have found the file, paste the code that you copied from Tolstoy into the code line where you want the Tolstoy video to appear and hit **Save**.
