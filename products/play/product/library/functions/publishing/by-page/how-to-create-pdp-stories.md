Once you have created the Stories (for Product pages or any other pages), you will be redirected to its own dashboard.
(**Remember**: If you create a layout/feature, not just Stories but for all types of layouts/features in the Onsite tab, we call that a “Project” and each project has its own dashboard.) This is where you can manage the Videos, Design, and the Analytics of that project you created.
