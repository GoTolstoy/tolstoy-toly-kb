Once you have created the Carousel, you will be redirected to its own dashboard. **Note**: If you create a layout/feature, not just Carousel but for all types of layouts/features in the Onsite tab, it's referred to as a **Project**, and each project has its own dashboard. Here, you can manage the Videos, Design, and Analytics of the project you created.

## Carousel Tabs

In a Carousel Project Dashboard, youâ€™ll find three tabs:

1. **Videos**: Manage which videos will be shown for the specific project.

2. **Design**: Edit the appearance of the Carousel and customize the player feed. Note that there are two types of Carousel, the **Default Carousel** and **Spotlight Carousel**.
