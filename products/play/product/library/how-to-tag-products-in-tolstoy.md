## How to Tag Products in Tolstoy

Few things to consider:

1. If the platform you integrated with Tolstoy is Shopify, you can tag products by going to the "Library" tab and clicking the "Products" button for the video that you want to tag. Your products from Shopify will automatically be fetched.

2. If you’re using a native site or any other eCommerce platform like BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Wix, etc., you need to upload a CSV file that contains your products to the Tolstoy app. This allows you to tag videos with products. If you don’t upload a CSV with your products, you won’t be able to see the "Products" button and therefore cannot tag products.
