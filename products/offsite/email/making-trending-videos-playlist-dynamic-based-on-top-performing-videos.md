# Making Trending Videos Playlist Dynamic Based on Top-Performing Videos

To make the 'trending videos' playlist dynamic based on top-performing videos, you would need to integrate an algorithm or a feature that automatically updates the playlist based on video performance metrics such as views, likes, and engagement.

## Steps to Implement a Dynamic Playlist

1. **Collect Performance Metrics**: Gather data on video performance, including views, likes, comments, and shares. This data can be collected through your platform's analytics tools or third-party services.

2. **Define Criteria for 'Trending'**: Establish what metrics will determine if a video is trending. For example, you might decide that a video needs a certain number of views and likes within a specific timeframe to be considered trending.

3. **Develop an Algorithm**: Create an algorithm that evaluates videos based on the defined criteria. The algorithm should be able to rank videos and identify the top-performing ones.

4. **Automate Playlist Updates**: Implement a system that automatically updates the 'trending videos' playlist based on the algorithm's output. This could be done through scheduled scripts or real-time updates.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the performance of the dynamic playlist and adjust the criteria or algorithm as needed to ensure it remains effective.

By following these steps, you can create a dynamic 'trending videos' playlist that reflects the most popular and engaging content on your platform.
