# Configuring Stories to Pop Up Instead of Full Page

If you prefer your stories to pop up rather than display as a full page, you can easily configure this setting. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to your feed**: Navigate to the section where your stories are located, such as the 'Stories' feed.
2. **Open the design tab**: Look for the design tab within your feed settings.
3. **Locate Behavior settings**: Under the 'video feed' dropdown, find the 'Behavior' section.
4. **Toggle off full screen**: Turn off the 'view feed in full screen' option.

By following these steps, your stories will now pop up instead of taking up the entire page, providing a more streamlined viewing experience.
