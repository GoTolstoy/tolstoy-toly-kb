# Replacing Mobile Navigation Circles with Shoppable Videos

Yes, Tolstoy can replace mobile navigation circles with shoppable videos. However, the functionality will differ as the circles will open a shoppable video instead of navigating to another page.

## How It Works

When you replace mobile navigation circles with shoppable videos, users will experience a different interaction. Instead of the traditional navigation where circles lead to different pages, clicking on a circle will now open a shoppable video. This allows users to engage with video content directly and make purchases within the video.

## Benefits

**Enhanced User Engagement:** Shoppable videos can capture user attention more effectively than static navigation circles.

**Seamless Shopping Experience:** Users can watch videos and make purchases without leaving the current page, providing a smoother shopping experience.

**Increased Conversion Rates:** Engaging video content can lead to higher conversion rates as users are more likely to make a purchase after watching a compelling video.

## Implementation

To implement this feature, you will need to configure your mobile navigation settings within Tolstoy's platform. Ensure that each navigation circle is linked to a shoppable video. This setup will require some customization to ensure that the videos are properly integrated and functional.

## Considerations

- **User Experience:** Make sure that the transition from navigation circles to shoppable videos is smooth and intuitive for users.
- **Video Content:** Ensure that the videos are high-quality and provide clear calls to action to encourage purchases.
- **Technical Requirements:** Verify that your mobile platform supports video playback and shoppable features without performance issues.

By replacing mobile navigation circles with shoppable videos, you can create a more engaging and seamless shopping experience for your users.
