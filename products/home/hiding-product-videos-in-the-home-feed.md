# Hiding Product Videos in the Home Feed

To hide certain product videos in the home feed, you need to configure your Home feed settings. By default, the Home feed captures all videos that have at least one product tagged. To manage which videos appear, follow these steps:

1. **Create a 'Popular videos' feed**: This will allow you to have a separate feed where you can control the visibility of specific videos.
2. **Hide unwanted videos**: Hover over the video thumbnail of the video you want to hide. You will see an eye button appear. Click the eye button to hide the video from appearing in the Home feed.

By following these steps, you can ensure that only the desired product videos are visible in your Home feed.
