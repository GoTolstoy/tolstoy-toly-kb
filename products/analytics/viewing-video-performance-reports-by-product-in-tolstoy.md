1. **Identify Videos and Products**: List all the videos and the products they are associated with.
2. **Review Metrics**: Access the performance metrics for each video. This may include views, engagement rates, and other relevant statistics.
3. **Correlate Data**: Manually correlate the performance metrics with the respective products to understand how each product is performing based on the associated video.

By carefully reviewing and correlating video metrics with products, you can gain a better understanding of your video content's impact on product performance.
