# Handling Multiple Product Suggestions in Tolstoy

When Tolstoy receives an email containing multiple product suggestions, it follows a specific process to handle them efficiently. **Tolstoy prioritizes the first product suggested** in the email. It searches for videos that match this first product. If it finds three videos that match, the process stops there.

However, if Tolstoy does not find three videos for the first product, it moves on to the second product suggested in the email. The search continues in this manner, going through each product suggestion in the order they are listed, until it finds a product that matches three videos.

This method ensures that Tolstoy can provide relevant video content even when multiple product suggestions are provided, by systematically working through the list until the criteria are met.
