# Implementing and Customizing a Carousel on Your Website Using Tolstoy

## Creating an Image Carousel

You can create and customize image carousels directly through your Tolstoy account. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Go to 'All images':** Navigate to the 'All images' section in your Tolstoy account.
2. **Select the desired images:** Choose the images you want to include in your carousel.
3. **Add to carousel:** Click 'Add to carousel' to create your image carousel.

Alternatively, you can create a new carousel by following these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Carousels tab:** Go to the Carousels tab in your Tolstoy account.
2. **Click 'New carousel':** Select 'New carousel' to start creating a new image carousel.
3. **Select images from the library:** Choose the images you want to include from your image library.

## Customizing Your Carousel

### Automatic Product Tagging

Products tagged on the underlying images will be automatically tagged on the carousel. This feature ensures that your product tags are consistent across both individual images and the carousel.

### Manual Product Tagging

If needed, you can manually tag additional products on the images in your carousel. This allows for greater customization and ensures that all relevant products are highlighted.

## Adding the Carousel to Playlists and Widgets

Once your image carousel is created and customized, you can add it to your desired playlists. This allows you to use the carousel in widgets, just as you would with images and videos. Simply select the playlist where you want the carousel to appear and add it accordingly.
