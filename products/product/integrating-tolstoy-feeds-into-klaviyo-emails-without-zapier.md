# Integrating Tolstoy Feeds into Klaviyo Emails Without Zapier

Integrating Tolstoy feeds into Klaviyo emails can be done directly using Tolstoy's API. This method bypasses the need for third-party services like Zapier and allows for a more streamlined and customized integration. Below are the steps to achieve this:

## Access Tolstoy's API Documentation

1. **Log in to your Tolstoy account**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access API documentation.
2. **Navigate to the API section**: Find the API documentation within your Tolstoy account. This section will provide you with the necessary endpoints and authentication details.

## Set Up the Integration

1. **Generate an API key**: Follow the instructions in the API documentation to generate an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests.
2. **Create a script**: Write a script in your preferred programming language to fetch the Tolstoy feed data using the API. Ensure your script handles authentication and error checking.
3. **Format the data**: Once you have fetched the data, format it according to Klaviyo's requirements. This may involve converting the data into a specific JSON structure or other formats.
4. **Insert the data into Klaviyo**: Use Klaviyo's API or email template editor to insert the formatted Tolstoy feed data into your emails.

## Testing and Deployment

1. **Test the integration**: Before deploying, thoroughly test the integration to ensure that the Tolstoy feed data is correctly displayed in your Klaviyo emails.
2. **Deploy the integration**: Once testing is complete, deploy the integration to your live environment.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Tolstoy feeds into Klaviyo emails without relying on Zapier, providing a more tailored and efficient solution.
