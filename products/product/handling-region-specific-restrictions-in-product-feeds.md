## Handling Region-Specific Restrictions in Product Feeds

When managing product feeds, it is crucial to address region-specific restrictions to ensure compliance and accuracy. These restrictions should be included directly in the product feed, clearly indicating which products are available in which regions. This can be efficiently managed by incorporating the region-specific information in the same API call used to retrieve the product price according to the region. By doing so, businesses can streamline their operations and provide accurate product availability information to their customers based on their location.
