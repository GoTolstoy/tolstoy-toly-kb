## Setting Up Rules in Klaviyo to Show Tolstoy Videos Based on Quiz Results

To set up rules in Klaviyo that will show a video from Tolstoy tagged as the same product in the quiz result, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create User Segments Based on Quiz Results

First, ensure you have created user segments in Klaviyo based on the quiz results. This segmentation will help in targeting the right audience with the appropriate video content.

### Step 2: Use Template-Based Product Trigger Events

If your email template for the quiz result is a template-based product trigger event, you can proceed to add one of the 'Flows' use cases, such as abandonment or post-purchase. These flows will help in automating the process of sending the right video content to the users.

### Step 3: Add 'Flows' Use Cases

In Klaviyo, navigate to the 'Flows' section and add a new flow. Choose a use case that fits your needs, such as abandonment or post-purchase. Configure the flow to include the Tolstoy video that matches the product tagged in the quiz result.

### Step 4: Test the Quiz Template

If the email template is not a template-based product trigger event, you may need to discuss internally with your product team to better understand how to implement this. In such cases, it is recommended to share collaborator access to Klaviyo with the relevant team members so they can test the quiz template if needed.

By following these steps, you can effectively set up rules in Klaviyo to show Tolstoy videos based on quiz results, ensuring a personalized and engaging experience for your users.
