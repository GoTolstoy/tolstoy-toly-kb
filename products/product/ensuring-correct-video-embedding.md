# Ensuring Correct Video Embedding

To ensure that a video is correctly embedded, follow these steps:

1. **Follow Up with the Client**: After embedding the video, reach out to the client to confirm that the video appears and functions as expected on their end. This step is crucial to identify any immediate issues that might not be visible from your side.

2. **Check the Page Builder**: Review the page builder or the platform where the video is embedded. Ensure that the video is placed correctly within the layout and that it is responsive across different devices and screen sizes.

3. **Offer to Make Adjustments**: Be proactive in offering to make any necessary adjustments. This could involve tweaking the video size, changing its position, or addressing any playback issues. Being flexible and responsive to the client's needs helps ensure a smooth and satisfactory embedding process.
