## Tolstoy and Checkout Extensibility Upgrades

No, Tolstoy does not need to take any action when a client upgrades their checkout pages to Checkout Extensibility. Tolstoy does not edit or modify anything within the Shopify checkout. It only points the products added to the cart to the checkout page, and the client's usual setup will start to kick in.
