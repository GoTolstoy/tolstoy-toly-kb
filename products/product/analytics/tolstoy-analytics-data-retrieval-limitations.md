# Tolstoy Analytics Data Retrieval Limitations

## Data Retrieval Period

Currently, Tolstoy analytics is set to pull data for the past 3 months. This means that any data older than 3 months is not automatically available through the standard analytics interface.

## Requesting Older Data

If you need to access data beyond this 3-month period, you will need to make a request to the backend team. They are equipped to handle such requests and can provide the necessary data upon request.
