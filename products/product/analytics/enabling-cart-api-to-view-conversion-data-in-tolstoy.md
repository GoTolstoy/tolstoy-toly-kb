# Enabling Cart API to View Conversion Data in Tolstoy

To see conversion data in Tolstoy, it is essential to enable the **Cart API**. Without enabling the Cart API, you will only have access to engagement data. Conversion data provides valuable insights into how users are interacting with your content and making purchases, which can help in optimizing your strategies and improving overall performance.

## Steps to Enable Cart API

1. **Access Tolstoy Settings**: Navigate to the settings section of your Tolstoy account.
2. **Locate Cart API Settings**: Find the Cart API settings within the settings menu.
3. **Enable Cart API**: Toggle the Cart API to the 'on' position to enable it.
4. **Save Changes**: Ensure you save any changes made to apply the new settings.

Once the Cart API is enabled, you will start seeing conversion data alongside engagement data, providing a more comprehensive view of your user interactions and sales performance.
