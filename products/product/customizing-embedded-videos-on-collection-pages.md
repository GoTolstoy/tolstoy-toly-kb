# Customizing Embedded Videos on Collection Pages

Embedded videos on collection pages offer a range of customization options to enhance the user experience. Here are some of the customizations you can make:

## Using CSS

You can use CSS to customize various elements of embedded videos. For example:

- **Full Screen Width**: You can set the video to occupy the full width of the screen.
- **Fixed Height**: You can specify a fixed height for the video to maintain consistency across different devices.

## Additional Customizations

Some customizations may require development support. These include:

- **Removing Overlays**: If you want to remove overlays from the video, you may need to involve a developer.
- **Adding Title Overlays**: Adding title overlays to the video is another customization that might require development assistance.

By leveraging these customization options, you can create a more engaging and visually appealing experience for users on your collection pages.
