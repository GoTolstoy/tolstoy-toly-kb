## Displaying Thank You Videos on Shopify Thank You Page

### Current Limitations

Displaying thank you videos on the Shopify thank you page is currently not supported. This limitation is due to the deprecation of `checkout.liquid`, which previously allowed for more customization options.

### Possible Workaround

While direct support is not available, you might find a workaround using third-party apps. These apps can allow embedding HTML and adding custom JavaScript to your Shopify store. By leveraging these tools, you may be able to display thank you videos on the thank you page.

### Conclusion

Although Shopify's native functionality does not support thank you videos on the thank you page, exploring third-party apps that offer HTML embedding and custom JS capabilities might provide a viable solution.
