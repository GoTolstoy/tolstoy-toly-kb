# Can Tolstoy Automatically Untag Sold-Out Products

Currently, Tolstoy does not have an automatic untagging feature for sold-out products. However, the feedback has been noted for future consideration. This means that while the feature is not available at the moment, it may be included in future updates based on user feedback and demand.
