## Causes of Video Duplication Issues

Video duplication issues in Tolstoy can occur when the same videos are uploaded to multiple social media channels (e.g., Instagram and TikTok) and both channels are connected to Tolstoy. This results in the same video being pulled from different sources and tagged twice.

## How to Prevent Video Duplication

Clients can prevent video duplication by choosing a primary channel tab (either TikTok or Instagram) to pull videos from and tagging videos from just one source library. They should avoid tagging directly in the 'all videos' tab.
