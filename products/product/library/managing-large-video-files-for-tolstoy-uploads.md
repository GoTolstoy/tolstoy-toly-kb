## Managing Large Video Files for Tolstoy Uploads

If your video file exceeds the maximum size limit for your current plan on Tolstoy, there are several steps you can take to address this issue:

1. **Compress the Video**: Use video compression tools like Handbrake or Adobe Media Encoder to reduce the file size without significantly compromising quality.

2. **Upgrade Your Plan**: Consider upgrading your Tolstoy plan to increase the file size limit, allowing you to upload larger video files.

3. **Split the Video**: Divide the video into smaller parts that fall within the size limit and upload them separately.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage large video files and ensure they are suitable for upload to Tolstoy.
