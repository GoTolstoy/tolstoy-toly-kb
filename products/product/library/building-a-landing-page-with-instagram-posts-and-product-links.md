## Building a Landing Page with Instagram Posts and Product Links

Currently, Tolstoy offers the capability to connect your Instagram account directly to our platform, which can then be used to tag products and manage content effectively. However, Tolstoy does not have a native feature to create a landing page directly from Instagram posts without using external apps.

To achieve this, you would need to use external tools or apps that can pull posts from Instagram and link them to product pages. These tools can help you create a seamless experience by integrating your Instagram content with your product offerings on a landing page.
