## Actions Taken to Address Duplication Issue

### Manual Hiding of Duplicated Videos
The Customer Success Manager (CSM) took action to address the duplication issue by manually hiding the duplicated videos. This step was essential to ensure that only one version of each video was visible to users, thereby reducing confusion and maintaining a clean video library.

### Untagging Videos with Same Product
In addition to hiding the duplicated videos, the CSM also untagged videos that included the same product as the other copy of the same videos. This action helped to further differentiate the videos and prevent any overlap or redundancy in the video content related to the same product.
