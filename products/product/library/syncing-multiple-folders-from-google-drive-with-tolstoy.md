# Syncing Multiple Folders from Google Drive with Tolstoy

## Current Capabilities

Currently, Tolstoy doesn't support syncing multiple folders directly from Google Drive. Users can upload individual videos or images from Google Drive to their Tolstoy account, but there isn't an automatic sync feature for entire folders.

## Uploading Individual Files

While automatic folder syncing is not available, you can still upload individual files from Google Drive to your Tolstoy account. This allows you to selectively choose which videos or images you want to use in your Tolstoy projects.

## Future Updates

Keep an eye on future updates from Tolstoy, as new features and improvements are regularly added. Automatic folder syncing might be a feature that could be included in future releases.
