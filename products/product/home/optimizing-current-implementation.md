## Optimizing Current Implementation

To optimize the current implementation, consider the following steps:

1. **Increase Product and Video Coverage**: Expanding the range of products and videos available can attract a broader audience and provide more value to users.

2. **Tag Home Page Videos**: Tagging videos on the home page can improve searchability and user experience, making it easier for visitors to find relevant content.

3. **Change Titles to be Powered by Shopify**: Updating titles to indicate they are powered by Shopify can enhance credibility and trust among users, leveraging Shopify's reputation.

4. **Link to Instagram**: Adding links to Instagram can drive traffic from social media, increase engagement, and provide additional channels for users to interact with the brand.
