## Introduction

A/B testing is a powerful method to compare different versions of your content to see which one performs better in terms of conversion rate (CVR) and bounce rate. Tolstoy supports A/B testing, allowing you to optimize your content and improve your site's performance.

## Setting Up A/B Testing

To set up A/B testing with Tolstoy, you can create different versions of your content. These versions will be shown to different segments of your audience. By analyzing the performance metrics of each version, you can determine which one is more effective.

## Measuring Impact

### Conversion Rate (CVR)

Conversion rate is a key metric that indicates the percentage of visitors who take a desired action on your site. By comparing the CVR of different content versions, you can identify which version is more successful in driving conversions.

### Bounce Rate

Bounce rate measures the percentage of visitors who leave your site after viewing only one page. A lower bounce rate generally indicates that visitors are more engaged with your content. A/B testing can help you find the content version that keeps visitors on your site longer.

## Conclusion
