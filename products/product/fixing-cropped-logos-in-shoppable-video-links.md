# Fixing Cropped Logos in Shoppable Video Links

When dealing with shoppable video links, a common issue that arises is the cropping of logos. This can detract from the overall professionalism and effectiveness of your video. Here are steps to ensure your logo appears correctly:

## Optimize Logo Dimensions

The first step is to ensure that your logo image dimensions are optimized for the platform you are using. Each platform may have specific requirements or recommendations for image sizes. Check the platform's guidelines and adjust your logo accordingly.

## Adjust Image Size

If your logo is being cropped, you may need to resize the image. Use an image editing tool to adjust the dimensions of your logo so that it fits within the designated space without being cut off. Ensure that the aspect ratio is maintained to avoid distortion.

## Change Image Format

Sometimes, the format of the image can affect how it is displayed. If resizing does not solve the issue, try changing the image format (e.g., from PNG to JPEG) and see if that resolves the cropping problem.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your logo appears correctly in shoppable video links, maintaining a professional appearance and enhancing the viewer's experience.
