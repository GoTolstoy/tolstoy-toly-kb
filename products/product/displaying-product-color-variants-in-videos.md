# Displaying Product Color Variants in Videos

When showcasing products with multiple colorways, it is essential to ensure that the video reflects the color of the product variant selected by the user. This can be achieved by tagging a video on a variant level. By doing so, the specific video associated with the selected variant will be displayed, providing a more accurate and engaging user experience.

## How to Tag Videos on a Variant Level

1. **Identify the Variants**: Determine the different colorways or variants of the product that you want to showcase.
2. **Tag the Videos**: Assign or tag each video to the corresponding product variant. This ensures that when a user selects a particular variant, the associated video will be shown.
3. **Test the Functionality**: Ensure that the correct video is displayed when different variants are selected. This step is crucial to verify that the tagging has been done correctly.

By following these steps, you can enhance the user experience by displaying videos that accurately reflect the selected product variant.
