# Getting Product Prices for Specific Locales

When dealing with product prices in different locales, it is essential to use the correct method to ensure accuracy. The correct way to get product prices for specific locales is to use the **currency code** along with the **site ID**. This combination allows you to retrieve the correct prices for the desired locale.

## Steps to Retrieve Prices

1. **Identify the Currency Code**: Determine the currency code for the locale you are targeting. For example, USD for United States, EUR for Europe, etc.
2. **Determine the Site ID**: Each locale or region may have a specific site ID associated with it. Ensure you have the correct site ID for the locale.
3. **Combine Currency Code and Site ID**: Use both the currency code and site ID together in your request to retrieve the accurate product prices.

By following these steps, you can ensure that you are getting the correct product prices for any specific locale.
