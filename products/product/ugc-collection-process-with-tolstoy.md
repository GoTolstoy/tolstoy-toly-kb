## UGC Collection Process with Tolstoy

Tolstoy facilitates **User-Generated Content (UGC) collection** by following a streamlined process:

1. **Email Campaigns**: Tolstoy reaches out to customers through targeted email campaigns. These emails invite customers to participate in creating UGC.

2. **Branded Landing Page**: Customers are directed to a branded landing page where they can learn more about the UGC campaign and its requirements.

3. **Video Recording**: On the landing page, customers can record their videos directly in their browser. This eliminates the need for any additional software or complicated steps.

4. **Submission and Review**: Once the video is recorded, it is submitted for brand review and approval. The brand reviews the content to ensure it meets their standards and guidelines.

5. **Rewards and Payment**: Customers are rewarded, and Tolstoy is paid only if the video is accepted by the brand. This ensures that only high-quality content is collected and incentivizes customers to produce their best work.

This process ensures a seamless and efficient way to collect high-quality UGC that aligns with brand standards.
