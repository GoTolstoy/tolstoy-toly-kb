# Difference Between Tolstoy Carousel and Stories Features

When using Tolstoy to showcase your products, you have two distinct features to choose from: the **carousel** and **stories**. Each serves a unique purpose and offers different ways to engage with your audience.

## Carousel Feature

The **carousel feature** displays a rotating selection of content. This is ideal for showcasing multiple products or pieces of content in a single, interactive view. Users can swipe or click through the carousel to see different items, making it a dynamic way to present a variety of options without overwhelming the viewer.

## Stories Feature

The **stories feature** provides a narrative format for showcasing products. This is perfect for telling a story or guiding users through a sequence of content. Stories are typically more immersive and can be used to create a more engaging and cohesive experience, often with a beginning, middle, and end.

## Key Differences

- **Format**: Carousel is a rotating selection of content, while Stories is a narrative sequence.
- **User Interaction**: Carousel allows users to swipe or click through items, whereas Stories guide users through a set sequence.
- **Use Case**: Use Carousel for displaying multiple products or content pieces; use Stories for a more immersive, narrative-driven experience.
