# Handling 2-Tile Carousel Requests in Tolstoy

## Understanding the 3-Tile Carousel Requirement
Tolstoy currently supports only 3-tile carousels. This means that any carousel created within the platform must contain exactly three tiles. This can be a limitation for clients who wish to create a 2-tile carousel.

## Solutions for 2-Tile Carousel Requests
### Adding an Additional Video
One straightforward solution is to add an additional video to meet the 3-tile requirement. This way, the client can still utilize the carousel feature by simply including an extra piece of content.

### Opting for a Single GIF Tile
Alternatively, clients can opt for a single GIF tile instead of a carousel. This allows for a dynamic and engaging presentation without the need to meet the 3-tile requirement.

## Conclusion
While Tolstoy currently supports only 3-tile carousels, clients can either add an additional video to meet this requirement or choose to use a single GIF tile as an alternative. These solutions ensure that clients can still create engaging and dynamic content within the platform's constraints.
