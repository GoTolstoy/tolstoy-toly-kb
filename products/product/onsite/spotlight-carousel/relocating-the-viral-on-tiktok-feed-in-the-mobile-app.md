## Understanding the Placement

The 'viral on TikTok' feed, also known as the FYP (For You Page), is a prominent feature within the mobile app. However, there isn't a way to relocate the FYP from the admin panel. This means that any changes to its placement need to be done manually.

## Installing in the Desired Placement

To move the 'viral on TikTok' feed to a different location within the mobile app, it must be installed in the desired placement with the correct codes. This involves modifying the app's codebase to ensure that the FYP appears where you want it to.

### Steps to Install
1. **Access the Codebase**: Gain access to the mobile app's codebase where the FYP is currently implemented.
2. **Identify the Current Placement**: Locate the section of the code where the FYP is currently placed.
3. **Modify the Code**: Adjust the code to change the placement of the FYP to the desired location.
4. **Test the Changes**: Ensure that the changes are correctly implemented by testing the app thoroughly.

## Conclusion

Relocating the 'viral on TikTok' feed within the mobile app requires manual adjustments to the app's code. It cannot be done through the admin panel and must be installed in the desired placement with the correct codes.
