## Current Issues with Tolstoy Carousels on Fenty UK Sites

### Home Page
The Fenty UK site has the correct PUBLISH ID on the home page. This means that the Tolstoy carousels should be functioning correctly on this page without any issues.

### Product Page
The product page on the Fenty UK site requires a snippet change. This indicates that there might be a problem with how the Tolstoy carousels are being displayed or functioning on the product page, and updating the snippet should resolve this issue.

### Staging Site
The staging site for Fenty UK has two main issues:
1. **Incorrect PUBLISH ID on the Product Page**: The PUBLISH ID on the product page of the staging site is incorrect, which could lead to the Tolstoy carousels not displaying or functioning as intended.
2. **Carousel Positioning Issue**: There is a problem with the positioning of the carousels on the staging site, which might affect the user experience by misaligning the carousels or placing them in unintended locations.
