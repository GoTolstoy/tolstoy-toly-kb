# Integrating Tolstoy Videos into Tapcart Product Pages

## Overview

Integrating Tolstoy videos into the product page of your Tapcart app is possible and will enhance the user experience by providing engaging video content directly on your product pages. This feature is currently being developed and is expected to be live within a week.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced User Engagement**: Videos can capture the attention of users more effectively than static images or text.
- **Improved Product Understanding**: Demonstrating products through videos can help users understand the features and benefits more clearly.
- **Increased Conversion Rates**: Engaging video content can lead to higher conversion rates as users are more likely to make a purchase after watching a video.

## Implementation

Once the feature is live, you will be able to integrate Tolstoy videos into both the product pages and the homepage of your Tapcart app. This will allow you to provide a consistent and engaging user experience across different sections of your app.

Stay tuned for the release of this feature, which is expected to be available within a week.
