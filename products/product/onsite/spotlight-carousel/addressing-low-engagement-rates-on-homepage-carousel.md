### Improving User Experience

Another solution is to improve the overall user experience by:
- **Simplifying the interface** to make it more intuitive for users to understand the available actions.
- **Testing different carousel designs** to find the most effective layout that encourages user interaction.

### Utilizing Analytics

Finally, leveraging analytics can provide insights into user behavior. By analyzing data, the client can:
- **Identify patterns** in how users interact with the carousel.
- **Make data-driven decisions** to optimize the carousel for better engagement.

## Conclusion
