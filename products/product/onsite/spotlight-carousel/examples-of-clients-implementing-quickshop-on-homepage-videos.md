# Examples of Clients Implementing Quickshop on Homepage Videos

## Overview

Quickshop is a feature that allows users to add items to their cart directly from a video. This feature can be particularly useful for e-commerce brands looking to streamline the shopping experience for their customers.

## Example: Fenty

One notable example of a client who has implemented Quickshop on their homepage videos is Fenty. The Fenty setup was customized based on their specific request. They are currently the only brand that utilizes the Quick Shop modal hooked to our Spotlight + buttons. This customization allows users to interact with the video and add items to their cart seamlessly.

## Default Behavior

The default behavior of the + button in Quickshop is to add the tagged item directly to the cart. This makes it easy for users to shop for products featured in the video without navigating away from the content.

## Conclusion

While Fenty is currently the only brand using this specific setup, the Quickshop feature offers a versatile solution for other brands looking to enhance their e-commerce experience. By integrating Quickshop, brands can provide a more interactive and efficient shopping experience for their customers.
