# Integrating Videos into PDP Carousel Without Play Button Overlay

When integrating videos into the Product Detail Page (PDP) carousel, it is possible to embed the video in a landscape format without displaying a play button overlay. This allows for a cleaner and more streamlined visual presentation, enhancing the user experience by removing unnecessary elements that might distract from the product visuals.

To achieve this, ensure that the video settings are configured to disable the play button overlay. This can typically be done through the video embedding options provided by the platform you are using. By doing so, the video will seamlessly integrate into the carousel, maintaining the aesthetic consistency of the product page.
