# Spotlight Carousel Video Auto-Play Order

The Spotlight carousel determines which video auto-plays first by positioning the first video in the middle of the carousel. This video is set to auto-play as soon as the carousel is loaded. This ensures that the most important or featured content is immediately visible and engaging to the viewer.
