## New Features Requested for KitchenAid PDP Redesign

### Spotlight Carousel Below the Fold
One of the new features requested for the KitchenAid PDP (Product Detail Page) redesign is the addition of a **Spotlight Carousel** below the fold. This feature aims to highlight key products or promotions in a visually engaging manner, enhancing the user experience and drawing attention to important content.

### Videos in the Product Gallery
Another requested feature is the inclusion of **videos in the product gallery**. This addition allows users to view product videos directly within the gallery, providing a more dynamic and informative browsing experience. Videos can help demonstrate product features, usage, and benefits more effectively than static images alone.

### YouTube Videos in the Features Section
The final requested feature is the integration of **YouTube videos in the features section**. By embedding YouTube videos, the PDP can offer detailed visual explanations and demonstrations of product features. This can help potential customers better understand the product's capabilities and make more informed purchasing decisions.
