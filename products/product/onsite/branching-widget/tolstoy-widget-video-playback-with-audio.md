# Tolstoy Widget Video Playback with Audio

Tolstoy's current widget is designed to play only the first 3-5 seconds of the video in the small popup. To play the entire video with audio, the widget needs to be expanded. This design ensures that users get a quick preview of the content before deciding to engage further by expanding the widget.
