## Sale Price Not Displaying on Tolstoy Shoppable Widget

If the sale price is not displaying on the shoppable widget in Tolstoy, it is likely because the sale price is set through a Subscription App. Tolstoy can only pull pricing data directly from the Shopify API. Therefore, any pricing information set outside of Shopify's native system, such as through third-party apps, will not be reflected in the Tolstoy shoppable widget.
