# Improving Carousel Appearance with Titles and Reduced Congestion

To enhance the visual appeal and functionality of the carousel, it was suggested to implement two key changes:

## Adding a Title Above the Carousel

Including a title above the carousel can provide context to the users, making it clear what the carousel is about. This can improve user engagement and understanding.

## Hiding the Static Carousel 'Follow the Fun'

To reduce page congestion and create a cleaner look, it was recommended to hide the static carousel 'Follow the Fun'. This can help in decluttering the page and focusing user attention on more dynamic and relevant content.
