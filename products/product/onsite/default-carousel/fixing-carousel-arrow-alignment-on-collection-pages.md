## Fixing Carousel Arrow Alignment on Collection Pages

To fix the alignment of carousel arrows on collection pages, you can add the following CSS code:

```css
.tolstoy-next-button {
  margin-bottom: 7px !important;
}
```

This code adjusts the margin at the bottom of the next button, ensuring that the arrows are properly aligned.
