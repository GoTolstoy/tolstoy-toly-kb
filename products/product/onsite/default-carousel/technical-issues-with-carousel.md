## Technical Issues with Carousel

The client encountered two primary technical issues with the carousel:

1. **Product Name Cut Off**: The product names were getting truncated in the carousel, which likely affected the readability and user experience.

2. **Absence of Scroll Arrows on Mobile Devices**: On mobile devices, the carousel lacked scroll arrows, making it difficult for users to navigate through the products efficiently.
