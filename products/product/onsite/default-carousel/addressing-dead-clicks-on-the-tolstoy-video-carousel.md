# Addressing Dead Clicks on the Tolstoy Video Carousel

Dead clicks on the Tolstoy video carousel can be a frustrating issue, but there are a couple of effective strategies to address this problem.

## Make the Unmute Button More Prominent

One suggestion to reduce dead clicks is to make the **unmute button more prominent**. This can help users easily find and interact with the button, ensuring they can hear the audio and engage with the video content more effectively.

## Use the Default Style Carousel

Another approach is to use the **default style carousel**. This style automatically opens the feed player upon clicking, which can eliminate dead clicks entirely. By ensuring that any click on the carousel leads to the video playing, users are more likely to have a seamless and engaging experience.

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce dead clicks and improve user interaction with the Tolstoy video carousel.
