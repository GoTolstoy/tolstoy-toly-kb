## Adding Tolstoy Blocks to PDP Templates

Currently, it is not possible to add the Tolstoy block in the same placement on all Product Detail Page (PDP) templates out of the box. A ticket has been raised for this specific request, and updates will be provided once available.

## Showing/Hiding Tolstoy Blocks on PDP Templates

The implementation of Tolstoy Stories on PDP templates is done through coding. To show or hide these blocks, you must use CSS. A CSS code snippet can be provided, which you can paste or remove as needed to control the visibility of the Tolstoy blocks.
