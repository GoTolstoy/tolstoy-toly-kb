## Differentiating Product Demo Videos on Mobile and Desktop

Adding a video on stories that's specific to desktop is challenging as it would result in having two different stories on the same page. Adjusting the positioning of the demo video on the desktop to avoid it being cut off is a suggested solution.

### Challenges
- **Two Different Stories**: Having separate videos for mobile and desktop can lead to the issue of displaying two different stories on the same page, which can be confusing for users.

### Suggested Solution
- **Adjust Positioning**: To ensure the demo video is not cut off on desktop, adjust its positioning. This way, the same video can be used across both platforms without the need for separate stories.

By focusing on the positioning of the video, you can create a seamless experience for users on both mobile and desktop platforms without the complexity of managing multiple stories.
