# Adding Titles to PDP Stories Playlists and Engagement

## Introduction

Adding a title to PDP Stories Playlists can sometimes improve engagement by providing context to the content. However, the impact of adding a title can vary depending on the specific design and audience.

## Benefits of Adding Titles

### Providing Context

A well-chosen title can give viewers a clear idea of what to expect from the playlist, which can make the content more appealing and engaging.

### Enhancing Discoverability

Titles can also help in making the content more discoverable, as they can be optimized for search engines and social media platforms.

## Testing for Best Results

### A/B Testing

We recommend conducting A/B testing to determine whether adding a title improves engagement for your specific audience. This involves creating two versions of the playlist—one with a title and one without—and comparing the engagement metrics.

### Audience Feedback

Collecting feedback from your audience can also provide valuable insights into whether titles are beneficial. Surveys, comments, and direct feedback can help you understand your audience's preferences.

## Conclusion

While adding a title to PDP Stories Playlists can potentially improve engagement by providing context and enhancing discoverability, it is essential to test this feature with your specific audience to see what works best. Conducting A/B tests and gathering audience feedback are effective ways to make an informed decision.
