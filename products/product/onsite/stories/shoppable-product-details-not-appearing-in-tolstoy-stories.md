## Shoppable Product Details Not Appearing in Tolstoy Stories

When using Tolstoy stories, you might encounter an issue where shoppable product details are not appearing for some videos. This typically happens when there is more than one product tagged in a video. In such cases, users need to click 'View Product' to see the shoppable product details.

### Solution
To ensure that the carousel shows shoppable product details directly, make sure to tag only one product per video. This will allow the product details to be displayed without requiring additional user interaction.
