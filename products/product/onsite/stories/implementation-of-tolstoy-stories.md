# Implementation of Tolstoy Stories

The implementation of Tolstoy Stories is managed through coding. This involves writing and integrating code to create and display the stories on a platform. The ability to show or hide these stories is controlled via CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

## Coding

The core of Tolstoy Stories' implementation lies in the coding process. Developers write scripts that define how the stories are created, managed, and displayed. This includes setting up the structure, content, and interactive elements of the stories.

## CSS Control

CSS is used to control the visibility of Tolstoy Stories. By applying specific CSS rules, developers can show or hide the stories as needed. This allows for dynamic control over the presentation of the stories, ensuring they appear or disappear based on certain conditions or user interactions.

In summary, the implementation of Tolstoy Stories is a combination of coding for functionality and CSS for visibility control.
