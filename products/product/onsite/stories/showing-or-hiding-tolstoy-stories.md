## Showing or Hiding Tolstoy Stories

Tolstoy Stories can be shown or hidden using a CSS code snippet provided by the CSM. This allows for greater control over when and where the stories appear on your website, ensuring they are only visible when you want them to be.

### How to Use the CSS Code Snippet

1. **Obtain the CSS Code Snippet**: Contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to get the specific CSS code snippet required to show or hide Tolstoy Stories.
2. **Add the CSS Code to Your Website**: Once you have the code snippet, you need to add it to your website's CSS file. This can usually be done through your website's content management system (CMS) or by directly editing the CSS file.
3. **Test the Changes**: After adding the CSS code, make sure to test your website to ensure that the Tolstoy Stories are being shown or hidden as expected.

By following these steps, you can easily manage the visibility of Tolstoy Stories on your website.
