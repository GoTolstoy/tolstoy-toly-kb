# Resolving Font Discrepancies on Product Detail Pages

When the font on the Product Detail Page (PDP) does not match the rest of the site, it is important to address this issue promptly to maintain a consistent user experience. Here are the steps to resolve font discrepancies on PDPs:

## Investigate the Issue

First, thoroughly investigate the issue by comparing the letter spacing and font settings on the PDP with those on the rest of the site. This will help you identify any inconsistencies.

## Make Necessary Adjustments

Once you have identified the discrepancies, make the necessary adjustments to the font settings on the PDP. Ensure that the letter spacing, font family, and other related settings match those used across the site. This will help in maintaining a uniform look and feel throughout the website.

By following these steps, you can effectively resolve font discrepancies on Product Detail Pages and ensure a seamless and consistent user experience.
