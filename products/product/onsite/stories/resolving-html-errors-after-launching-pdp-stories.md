# Resolving HTML Errors After Launching PDP Stories

If you encounter an HTML error after launching PDP (Product Detail Page) stories, it is crucial to address the issue promptly to ensure a seamless user experience. Here are the steps to resolve the problem:

1. **Investigate the Issue**: The first step is to have a developer investigate the error. This is important because the root cause of the issue may be related to the product page template.

2. **Check Product Page Template**: Verify if the product page template supports the addition of blocks. If it does not, this could be the source of the HTML error.

3. **Integrate Stories into Theme's Liquid Files**: If the product page template does not support blocks, Tolstoy can assist by integrating the stories directly into the theme's liquid files. This integration can help bypass the limitations of the template and resolve the HTML error.

By following these steps, you can effectively address and resolve HTML errors that occur after launching PDP stories, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience.
