# New Feature in Tolstoy's In-App PDP

Tolstoy is introducing an exciting new feature to its in-app Product Detail Page (PDP). This feature leverages **metafields** to enhance the visual representation of products. Specifically, it allows for the display of images or hex codes for color representation.

## Leveraging Metafields

Metafields are a powerful way to store additional information about products. By using metafields, Tolstoy can now show more detailed and visually appealing product information directly within the app. This can include high-quality images or specific color codes, making it easier for users to understand and visualize the product.

### Displaying Images

With this new feature, images can be directly associated with product variants. This means that users can see exactly what a product looks like in different colors or styles, enhancing their shopping experience.

### Hex Codes for Color Representation

In addition to images, Tolstoy's in-app PDP can now display colors using hex codes. This allows for precise color representation, ensuring that users have a clear and accurate understanding of the product's appearance.

By integrating these capabilities, Tolstoy is making its in-app PDP more informative and user-friendly, ultimately improving the overall shopping experience.
