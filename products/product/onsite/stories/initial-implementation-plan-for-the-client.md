# Initial Implementation Plan for the Client

## Launching PDP Stories
The first step in the implementation plan is to launch PDP Stories. This involves integrating Tolstoy's interactive video stories into the client's product detail pages (PDP). These stories will enhance the user experience by providing engaging and informative content directly on the product pages.

## Replacing IG Carousel with Tolstoy
The next phase involves replacing the existing Instagram (IG) carousel with Tolstoy. This will allow the client to leverage Tolstoy's interactive video capabilities to create a more dynamic and engaging carousel experience for their users.

## Future Projects
### Hero Videos
One of the future projects includes the implementation of hero videos. These videos will be prominently displayed on the client's website, serving as a key visual element to capture visitors' attention and convey important messages.

### Dedicated Video Pages
Another future project is the creation of dedicated video pages. These pages will host a variety of video content, providing users with a centralized location to access and view the client's video materials.

### Videos in Emails
Lastly, the plan includes incorporating videos into email communications. This will enhance the client's email marketing efforts by making their emails more engaging and interactive through the use of video content.
