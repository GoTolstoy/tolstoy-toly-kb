## Adding Tolstoy Block to Specific PDP Templates

The Tolstoy block can be added to specific Product Detail Page (PDP) templates by pushing the code to the desired theme. This allows the client to test the theme before making it live, ensuring that everything works as expected.

## Hiding Tolstoy Stories with CSS

To hide the Tolstoy Stories, you can use the following CSS code:

```css
.tolstoy-stories {
  display: none !important;
}
```

This code should be placed at the bottom of the `r1c1a1.css` file to ensure that the Tolstoy Stories are hidden effectively.
