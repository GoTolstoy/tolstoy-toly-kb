# Adjusting Video Size on Product Page Stories

To prevent video cutoff on product page stories, you can adjust the video size by modifying the video embedding settings or using a pop-up format. Here are some methods to ensure full video visibility:

## Modify Video Player Settings

1. **Adjust Aspect Ratio**: Ensure the aspect ratio of the video matches the display area on the product page. This can prevent parts of the video from being cut off.
2. **Responsive Design**: Use responsive design techniques to make the video player adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
3. **Custom Embed Code**: Modify the embed code to set specific width and height parameters that fit within the product page layout.

## Use a Pop-Up Format

1. **Pop-Up Video Player**: Implement a pop-up video player that opens in a separate window or overlay. This allows the video to be viewed in its entirety without being constrained by the product page layout.
2. **Lightbox Effect**: Use a lightbox effect to display the video in a larger view when clicked, ensuring no part of the video is cut off.

By adjusting the video embedding settings or using a pop-up format, you can ensure that videos on your product page stories are fully visible and not cut off.
