# Ensuring Correct Video Plays on PLP

If the correct video is not playing on the PLP (Product Listing Page), it is crucial to take the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Verify the Video**: Ensure that only the correct video is added to the widget. Double-check the video file and its settings to confirm it is the intended one.

2. **Client Confirmation**: Before making the video live, confirm with the client that the correct video has been added. This step is essential to avoid any miscommunication and ensure client satisfaction.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the correct video is playing on the PLP, thereby maintaining the quality and accuracy of the content presented to the users.
