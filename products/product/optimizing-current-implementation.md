## Tag Home Page Videos
Another crucial step is to **tag home page videos**. Tagging videos on the home page can help in better categorization and easier navigation for users. It also aids in improving the searchability of the videos, making it simpler for users to find the content they are interested in.

## Change the Title to be Powered by Shopify and Linkable to Instagram
The next step is to **change the title to be powered by Shopify and linkable to Instagram**. This not only enhances the branding but also provides a seamless connection to social media platforms, thereby increasing visibility and potential traffic from Instagram.

## Share the GA4 Tag ID
