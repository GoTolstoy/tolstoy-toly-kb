# Technical Issues with Tolstoy Product Card

## Issue Reported

Alexandre reported a technical issue with the Tolstoy product card. The problem is that products added to the cart from Tolstoy's product card are not immediately visible in the cart. Additionally, when these products are added again from the main Product Detail Page (PDP), they appear as duplicates in the cart.

## Impact

This issue can lead to confusion for customers as they may not see the products they have added to their cart right away. Furthermore, the appearance of duplicate products in the cart can cause frustration and may lead to abandoned carts or incorrect orders.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Add a product to the cart using Tolstoy's product card.
2. Check the cart to see if the product is visible.
3. Navigate to the main Product Detail Page (PDP) and add the same product to the cart again.
4. Observe the cart for duplicate entries of the product.

## Suggested Solutions

- **Immediate Cart Update:** Ensure that the cart updates immediately when a product is added from Tolstoy's product card.
- **Duplicate Check:** Implement a check to prevent duplicate entries when the same product is added from different sources.

Addressing these issues will improve the user experience and reduce the likelihood of cart abandonment or order errors.
