# Optimizing PDP Carousel Size for Products

To ensure the best user experience and engagement on your Product Detail Page (PDP), it is crucial to optimize the PDP Carousel size. Here are the steps to achieve optimal results:

## Set Carousel Size to Responsive

The first step is to set the PDP Carousel size to **'responsive'**. This ensures that the carousel adjusts automatically to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless viewing experience for all users.

## Add Multiple Videos

For optimal results, it is recommended to add at least **5 videos per product**. This not only enhances the visual appeal of the product page but also provides potential customers with a comprehensive view of the product, increasing the likelihood of a purchase.

By following these steps, you can significantly improve the effectiveness of your PDP Carousel and enhance the overall user experience on your product pages.
