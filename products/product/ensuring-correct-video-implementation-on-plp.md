## Ensuring Correct Video Implementation on PLP

When implementing a video on the Product Listing Page (PLP), it is crucial to ensure that the correct video is used. Here are the steps taken to achieve this:

1. **Removal of Other Videos**: All other videos were removed to avoid any confusion or mistakes. This step ensures that only the intended video remains for implementation.

2. **Client Confirmation**: Before finalizing the implementation, confirmation was sought from the client. This step is essential to verify that the correct video is being used and meets the client's expectations.

By following these steps, the correct video was successfully implemented on the PLP, ensuring accuracy and client satisfaction.
