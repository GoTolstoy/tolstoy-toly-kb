# Tolstoy TV Customization

## Customizing the Tolstoy TV Pop-up

There is limited customization available for the Tolstoy TV pop-up modal. This means that while you can control some aspects of the pop-up, such as the copy and certain branding elements, the options are not extensive.

## Recommended Approach

Given the limited customization options for the pop-up modal, it is recommended to create a dedicated TV page. This dedicated page can be fully customized to match your branding and content needs. Once the page is created, you can include the link to this TV page in the main header navigation of your website. This approach allows for greater flexibility and control over the appearance and functionality of your Tolstoy TV content.
