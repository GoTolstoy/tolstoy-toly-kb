## Resolving TV Mode Landing Page Issue

If you are experiencing an issue where the TV mode landing page appears instead of the designated URL source when recipients click on videos in emails, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. **Verify URL Configuration**: Ensure that the URL source in the product page is correctly updated to the designated URL. Double-check for any typos or incorrect links.

2. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes, cached data can cause outdated pages to appear. Clear the cache of your browser and any relevant servers to ensure the latest version of the page is loaded.

3. **Check Email Links**: Verify that the links in the emails are correctly pointing to the updated URL. Sometimes, the email template might still be using an old link.

4. **Update Email Templates**: If the email links are incorrect, update the email templates to ensure they point to the correct URL source.

5. **Test the Links**: Before sending out emails, test the links to ensure they direct to the correct landing page. This can help catch any issues before they reach the recipients.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the correct landing page is displayed when recipients click on videos in emails, resolving the issue of the TV mode landing page appearing instead of the designated URL source.
