## Difference Between Tolstoy TV and Thrive

**Tolstoy TV** triggers experiences such as post-purchase looks and inspiration videos, or trending social media videos in email templates. This means that Tolstoy TV is primarily used to enhance the customer experience through engaging video content delivered via email.

**Thrive**, on the other hand, is triggered on the Product Detail Page (PDP). This means that Thrive is designed to provide additional product information and engagement directly on the product page, helping customers make informed purchasing decisions.
