# Implementing Different Banner Structures and Adding Borders to Button Styling

## Implementing Different Banner Structures

Different banner structures can be implemented using pseudo CSS. Pseudo CSS allows you to create various styles and layouts for banners, enabling a more customized and visually appealing design. By using pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`, you can add decorative elements, shapes, and other design features to your banners without needing additional HTML markup.

### Example

```css
.banner::before {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 10px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

.banner::after {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 10px;
  background-color: #ccc;
}
```

## Adding Borders to Button Styling

Adding borders to button styling also requires custom CSS. By defining border properties in your CSS, you can create buttons with various border styles, colors, and widths. This allows for greater flexibility in button design, making them stand out and match the overall theme of your website or application.

### Example

```css
.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: 2px solid #000;
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.button:hover {
  border-color: #ff0000;
}
```

By using these CSS techniques, you can effectively implement different banner structures and add borders to button styling, enhancing the visual appeal and functionality of your web design.
