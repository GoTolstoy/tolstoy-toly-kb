# Role Of The Bellami Brand Team In Tolstoy Integration

## Responsibilities

The Bellami brand team plays a crucial role in the integration process with Tolstoy. Their primary responsibility is to **map products to videos**. This mapping is essential for ensuring that the correct videos are associated with the appropriate products.

## Mapping Process

The mapping process should be done via **SKU** (Stock Keeping Unit). Using SKUs helps avoid any potential impacts when restructuring product data in the production environment. This method ensures that the mapping remains consistent and accurate, even if there are changes in the product data structure.

## Important Considerations

- The mapping should **not** be completed on the development site. It is important to perform this task in the production environment to ensure accuracy and avoid discrepancies.

By following these guidelines, the Bellami brand team can effectively contribute to the successful integration with Tolstoy.
