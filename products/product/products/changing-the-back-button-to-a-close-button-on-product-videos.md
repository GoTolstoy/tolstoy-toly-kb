## Changing the Back Button to a Close Button on Product Videos

Currently, there is no setting or option to change the 'back' button to a 'close' button on product videos. The design allows users to go back and scroll through the rest of the video feed. This ensures a seamless user experience by enabling easy navigation through the video content.
