## Product Tagging Syndication in Tolstoy

Product tagging syndication in Tolstoy duplicates all products tagged on the global videos to the local store based on the SKU. This means that if a product is tagged in a global video, it will automatically appear in the local store's video if the SKU matches. However, if there are products with different SKUs, they need to be manually tagged to ensure they appear correctly in the local store's videos.
