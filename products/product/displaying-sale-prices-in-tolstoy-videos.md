# Displaying Sale Prices in Tolstoy Videos

When creating Tolstoy videos that feature products, it is important to display the correct pricing information to your audience. The client has specifically requested that the sale prices be shown instead of the regular prices for the products featured in the video. This ensures that viewers are aware of the current discounts and promotions, which can enhance the appeal of the products and potentially increase sales.

## Steps to Display Sale Prices

1. **Identify Sale Prices**: Ensure you have the correct sale prices for all the products you plan to feature in your Tolstoy video. This information should be up-to-date and accurate.

2. **Update Video Content**: When creating or editing your Tolstoy video, make sure to input the sale prices instead of the regular prices. This can be done through the video editing tools provided by Tolstoy.

3. **Verify Accuracy**: Double-check the video to ensure that all sale prices are correctly displayed. This step is crucial to avoid any potential confusion or misinformation.

4. **Publish and Monitor**: Once the video is published, monitor its performance and feedback to ensure that the pricing information is clear and effective in driving sales.

By following these steps, you can effectively display sale prices in your Tolstoy videos, providing your audience with the most relevant and enticing pricing information.
