## Tolstoy's UGC Collection Process

Tolstoy facilitates User-Generated Content (UGC) collection by collaborating with the client's CRM team. The process begins with reaching out to customers through email campaigns. These emails direct customers to a branded landing page where they can easily submit videos using a built-in recorder. Once the videos are submitted, they are reviewed and approved by the brand before being utilized.
