## Mobile Hero Video Not Showing Up on Site

If your mobile hero video is not showing up on your site, there could be several reasons for this issue. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. **Check CSS Code**: One common reason for the hero video not displaying on mobile devices is due to CSS code that hides the hero section. Inspect your CSS to ensure there are no styles that set the hero section to `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` on mobile devices.

2. **Verify Video File**: Ensure that the video file is correctly uploaded to your site. Double-check the file path and make sure there are no typos or errors in the URL.

3. **Supported Video Format**: Make sure the video format is supported on all mobile devices. Commonly supported formats include MP4, WebM, and Ogg. If your video is in a different format, consider converting it to a more widely supported one.

4. **Script Conflicts**: Check for any script conflicts that might be preventing the video from loading. This can include JavaScript errors or conflicts with other libraries or plugins used on your site.

5. **Tolstoy Dashboard Settings**: In the Tolstoy dashboard, ensure that both 'Display on mobile' and 'Display on desktop' options are enabled. This setting ensures that the hero video is visible on all devices.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing your mobile hero video from showing up on your site.
