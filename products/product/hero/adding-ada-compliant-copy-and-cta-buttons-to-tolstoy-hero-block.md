# Adding ADA-Compliant Copy and CTA Buttons to Tolstoy Hero Block

## ADA-Compliant Copy

Yes, ADA-compliant copy can be added to the Tolstoy Hero Block. This can be achieved by using CSS to ensure that there is enough contrast between the text and the background. Ensuring sufficient contrast is crucial for making text readable for users with visual impairments.

## CTA Buttons

Currently, the Hero section does not support CTA (Call to Action) buttons. However, this feature is on the roadmap for future updates. Stay tuned for upcoming enhancements that will include this functionality.
