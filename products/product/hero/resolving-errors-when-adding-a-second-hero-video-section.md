# Resolving Errors When Adding a Second Hero Video Section

## Understanding the Issue

When you encounter an error while adding a second Hero Video Section, it is likely due to a system limitation that only allows one 'hero' to be active at any given time. This restriction ensures that there is no conflict or overlap between multiple hero sections.

## Steps to Resolve the Error

### 1. Pause the Current Active Hero

To add a new Hero Video Section, you need to first pause the currently active hero. This can be done by navigating to the settings or control panel where the hero sections are managed.

### 2. Add the New Hero Video Section

Once the current hero is paused, you can proceed to add the new Hero Video Section without encountering the error. Follow the usual steps to add and configure the new section.

## Conclusion

By pausing the active hero before adding a new section, you can avoid errors and ensure smooth functionality. This approach helps maintain the integrity and performance of the system.
