# Fixing Hero Video Width Issues on Your Website

If your Hero video is not taking up the full width of your website, there are a couple of steps you can take to resolve this issue.

## Change Video Settings

First, try changing the video settings to **'Fixed'** instead of **'Responsive'**. This adjustment can often resolve width issues by ensuring the video maintains a consistent size across different devices and screen resolutions.

## Custom CSS

If changing the video settings does not resolve the issue, you may need to use custom CSS to adjust the theme settings. Custom CSS allows you to directly modify the appearance and layout of elements on your website, providing a more tailored solution to ensure your Hero video spans the full width of the page.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the issue of your Hero video not taking up the full width of your website.
