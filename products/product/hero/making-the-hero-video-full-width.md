# Making the Hero Video Full Width

If your hero video is not displaying as full width, it should be by default. Here are some steps to ensure it appears correctly:

1. **Check Theme Settings**: Go to your theme settings and verify that there are no margins on the left and right of the hero section. Margins can prevent the video from spanning the full width of the screen.

2. **Adjust CSS**: If the theme settings do not resolve the issue, you may need to adjust the CSS. Look for any CSS rules that might be adding padding or margins to the hero section and remove or modify them.

By following these steps, you should be able to make your hero video display full width as intended.
