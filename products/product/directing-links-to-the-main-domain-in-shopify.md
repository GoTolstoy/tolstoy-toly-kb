# Directing Links to the Main Domain in Shopify

In Shopify, ensuring that all links are directed to the main domain is crucial for maintaining a consistent brand presence and improving SEO. This can be managed under the **'Domains'** section in the admin settings. Hereâ€™s how you can set your primary domain and ensure all traffic is directed to this URL:

1. **Log in to your Shopify admin panel.**
2. **Navigate to the 'Domains' section.** You can find this under **Online Store > Domains**.
3. **Set your primary domain.** In the Domains section, you will see a list of all the domains connected to your store. Select the domain you want to set as your primary domain.
4. **Redirect all traffic to the primary domain.** Ensure that the option to redirect all traffic to this primary domain is enabled. This will ensure that any traffic to other domains will be automatically redirected to your main domain.

By following these steps, you can ensure that all your links are directed to your main domain, providing a seamless experience for your customers and improving your store's SEO.
