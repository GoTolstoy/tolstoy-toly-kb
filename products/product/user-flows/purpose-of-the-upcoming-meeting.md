# Purpose of the Upcoming Meeting

The upcoming meeting will focus on two main topics: **A/B testing** and **PDP widget evolution**. 

## A/B Testing

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. This process helps in making data-driven decisions to improve user experience and increase conversion rates.

## PDP Widget Evolution

PDP (Product Detail Page) widget evolution refers to the ongoing development and enhancement of the widgets used on product detail pages. These widgets are crucial for providing users with detailed information about products, improving the overall shopping experience, and driving sales. The meeting will discuss the latest updates and future plans for these widgets to ensure they meet user needs and business goals.
