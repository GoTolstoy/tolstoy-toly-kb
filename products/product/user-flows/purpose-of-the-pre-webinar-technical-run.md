# Purpose of the Pre-Webinar Technical Run

The pre-webinar technical run is intended to test the Crowdcast platform and ensure that all speakers are familiar with the technology and the questions to be addressed during the webinar. This preparatory step is crucial for a smooth and successful webinar experience. By conducting a technical run, potential technical issues can be identified and resolved beforehand, and speakers can gain confidence in using the platform. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to review the webinar's agenda and the specific questions that will be discussed, ensuring that everyone is well-prepared and aligned.
