## Handling Regional Feeds and Fetching Product Prices via API

### Sending Separate Feeds for Each Region

Yes, it is possible to send separate feeds for each region. However, it is important to note that if the products have different IDs for each region, they will be considered different products. Conversely, if they have the same IDs, they will be considered the same product, and only one version will be uploaded to the admin.

### Using an API to Fetch Product Prices and Currencies

Yes, you can use an API to fetch product prices and currencies. This approach allows for real-time updates and ensures accurate pricing information for different regions. Utilizing an API for this purpose can streamline the process and enhance the accuracy of the data presented to users.
