# Updating the Title in Tolstoy Email Design

When designing an email in Tolstoy, you might want to update the title 'See it in action' to better fit your content. To do this, you need to manually add a text block above the GIF carousel. The title is not automatically added to the GIF carousel, so this step is necessary to ensure your email has the desired title.

## Steps to Update the Title

1. **Open the Email Design Tool**: Start by opening the email design tool in Tolstoy.
2. **Add a Text Block**: Locate the option to add a text block. This is usually found in the toolbar or menu options.
3. **Position the Text Block**: Drag and drop the text block to the top of the email, above the GIF carousel.
4. **Edit the Text**: Click on the text block to edit it. Enter your desired title, such as 'See it in action' or any other title that fits your content.
5. **Save Your Changes**: Make sure to save your changes to ensure the new title is applied to your email design.

By following these steps, you can easily update the title in your Tolstoy email design to better match your content and engage your audience.
