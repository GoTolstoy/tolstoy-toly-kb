# Trialing Tolstoy Email Video Widget Without PDP Widget

Yes, it is possible to test the email video widget with the PDP widget hidden. Once the user is redirected to the PDP, the video will start playing automatically, and if they close it, they won't be able to watch the videos again.

This setup allows you to evaluate the effectiveness of the email video widget independently. By hiding the PDP widget, you can focus on how users interact with the video content delivered via email without the influence of the PDP widget. This can be particularly useful for A/B testing or for gathering user feedback on the email video experience alone.
