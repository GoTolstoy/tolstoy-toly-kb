## Adding Rules in Klaviyo for Tolstoy Videos Related to Cart Products

When using Klaviyo to show Tolstoy videos related to the product featured in the cart, you can leverage dynamic widgets like 'Abandonment Revival' and 'Post-Purchase Guides'. These widgets automatically generate multiple feeds based on the product triggered from an event in Klaviyo. This means you do not need to manually add any rules to your existing flows.

### Steps to Implement
1. **Add the Tolstoy Widget**: Integrate the Tolstoy widget into a flow that is triggered by a product-related event. This could be an event such as a product being added to the cart or a purchase being made.
2. **Automatic Feed Creation**: Once the widget is added, Tolstoy will automatically create a personalized feed for each email based on the products tagged in the Tolstoy admin.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your emails contain relevant Tolstoy videos without the need for additional rule-setting in Klaviyo.
