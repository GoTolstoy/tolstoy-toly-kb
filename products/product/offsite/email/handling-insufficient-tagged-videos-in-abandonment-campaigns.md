## Handling Insufficient Tagged Videos in Abandonment Campaigns

In the context of an Abandonment campaign, it is crucial to have a sufficient number of tagged videos related to the product. If there aren't three videos related to the product, no videos will be displayed. This ensures that the content remains relevant and engaging for the user.

However, Tolstoy is open to supporting any other fallback ideas the client may have. This flexibility allows clients to propose alternative solutions that can be implemented to maintain the effectiveness of the campaign even when the required number of tagged videos is not available.
