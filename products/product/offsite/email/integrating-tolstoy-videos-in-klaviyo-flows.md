## Integrating Tolstoy Videos in Klaviyo Flows

### Adding Tolstoy Videos to Product-Related Flows

You do not need to add any rules to your existing Klaviyo flows to show Tolstoy videos related to the product in the cart. Simply add the Tolstoy widget to a flow that is triggered by a product-related event. Based on the products tagged in the Tolstoy admin, a personalized feed will be created for each email.

### Handling Non-Template-Based Product Trigger Events

If your quiz result email template is not a template-based product trigger event, further discussion with the product team is required to understand how to implement this feature. Collaborator access to Klaviyo may be needed for testing.
