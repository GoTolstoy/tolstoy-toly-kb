## Making Links Open in a New Tab in Klaviyo Emails

To make links open in a new tab in Klaviyo emails, you need to include the `target='_blank'` attribute in your HTML when setting up the link. This attribute instructs the browser to open the link in a new tab.

If you are using a platform that generates the link for you, check if there is an option within their settings to set the link to open in a new tab. This can often be found in the link settings or advanced options section of the platform's interface.
