## Tracking Sales from Offsite Carousels in Tolstoy

Sales from offsite carousels are categorized based on their original location, even if they direct users back to the site. This helps in accurately tracking the effectiveness of different marketing strategies.

### Importance of Categorization

By categorizing sales based on their original location, Tolstoy ensures that businesses can accurately measure the performance of their offsite marketing efforts. This categorization allows for a clear understanding of which offsite carousels are driving the most traffic and sales, enabling businesses to optimize their marketing strategies accordingly.

### How It Works
