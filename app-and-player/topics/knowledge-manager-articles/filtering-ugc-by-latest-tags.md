# Filtering UGC by Latest Tags

Currently, the UGC Search section does not support filtering by the latest tags. Users can search for specific hashtags or view content where their brand is tagged, but sorting by the most recent tags is not a built-in feature.

## Suggested Workaround
While direct filtering by the latest tags is not available, users can utilize the search functionality to look up recent hashtags or tagged content as a workaround.

## Future Updates
We are always looking to improve our platform. If this feature becomes available in the future, we will update our users accordingly.
