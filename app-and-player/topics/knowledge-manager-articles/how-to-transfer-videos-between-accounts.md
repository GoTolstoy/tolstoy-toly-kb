# How to Transfer Videos Between Accounts

Transferring videos between accounts in Tolstoy can be essential when changing jobs or managing multiple business entities. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step, including the implications of removing an email from an account.

## Step 1: Verify Account Ownership
- Ensure you have administrative access to both the source and destination accounts.

## Step 2: Prepare Videos for Transfer
- Identify which videos need to be transferred. Tag or categorize them for easier processing.

## Step 3: Export Videos
- Use the export feature in the source account to download the videos to your local machine.

## Step 4: Import Videos to New Account
- Log into the destination account and use the import feature to upload the videos from your local machine.

## Step 5: Verify Transfer
- Check the destination account to ensure all videos have been successfully transferred and are fully functional.

## Removing an Email from an Account
- Understand that removing an email associated with a Tolstoy account does not automatically transfer content to a new account. Manual transfer of videos is necessary to retain access under a new email.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage video assets across multiple Tolstoy accounts, ensuring continuity and control over your content.
