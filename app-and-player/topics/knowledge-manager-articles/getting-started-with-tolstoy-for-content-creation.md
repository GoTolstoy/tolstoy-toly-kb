Welcome to your guide on creating engaging content with Tolstoy. Let's dive into setting up Product Page Stories, Homepage Spotlight, and Shop Videos. ðŸš€

## Product Page Stories

These are great for boosting conversions by showcasing dynamic product videos right on your product pages. You can create and publish these stories directly from your Tolstoy dashboard.

## Homepage Spotlight

This feature is perfect for engaging visitors right when they land on your site. You can highlight your brand's identity, new arrivals, or featured products through visual storytelling. You can create a carousel or hero layout for your homepage spotlight directly in the Tolstoy dashboard and integrate it into your Shopify homepage.

## Shop Videos

By integrating with the Shop App, your product-tagged videos can be featured on the home feed of every Shop App user, potentially driving significant traffic to your store.
