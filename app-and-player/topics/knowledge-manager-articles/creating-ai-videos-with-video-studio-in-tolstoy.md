# Creating AI Videos with Video Studio in Tolstoy

Currently, Tolstoy does not have a feature specifically named 'Video Studio' for creating AI videos. If you are looking to integrate AI-generated content, you might consider using external tools like Synthesia for AI video creation, which can then be imported into Tolstoy for further editing and distribution.

## Steps to Integrate AI Videos into Tolstoy:
1. Create your AI video using an external tool like Synthesia.
2. Export the video in a supported format.
3. Import the video into Tolstoy using the media upload feature.
4. Use Tolstoy's editing tools to customize the video, add interactive elements, and prepare it for distribution.

For more detailed instructions on using external tools for AI video creation or further assistance with Tolstoy's features, please refer to the specific tool's documentation or contact Tolstoy support.
