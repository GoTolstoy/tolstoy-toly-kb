# How to Contact Support

Before contacting support, make sure to try to solve your issue with Toly, the Tolstoy app AI chatbot. We are currently working to make Tolly smarter than he is now. If Toly is unable to help you with your issue or doesn't have the correct answer, don't hesitate to contact support by choosing the **Talk to Support** option. They will be happy to help you.

If you want to meet with the support team, you can set a meeting using Calendly. Here are the support team's calendars. Please pick a time that works best for you.
