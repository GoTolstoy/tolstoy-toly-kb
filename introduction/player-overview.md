# Player overview

Tolstoy is built of the app, the player and the widget. In the app users build and manage their widgets and players. The widget is the layout added to the sales channel (the entry point for web site) and the player is where the videos/ images play.

there are two types of players available, branching and swipeable (feed).

1. swipeable - this mimics tiktok’s feed and shows videos with vertical swiping. users can tag videos with product and the feed displays them with the video. 
    1. on mobile the feed’s player takes the entire screen showing products on video, on desktop there are two options available full screen (showing products on a panel on the right) ar picture in picture (showing products like on mobile). 
    2. there are 2 types of feeds, manual and automated. the manual is less popular, it allows users to select specific videos and add custom descriptions and links to each video, the con is that is hard to maintain and does not support all features. the automated showcases videos matching playlists dynamically, meaning it adds videos matching playlist automatically to feed and dynamically displays videos on pdp’s by the products tagged.
    3. there are 2 top tabs available on the feed, for you showing the feed’s selected videos by the app settings and wishlist showing saved products.
    4. the feed has 2 main screens, the video and the product card. the product card mimics the product page or the cart in case of multi products tagged. it allows to add to cart or proceed to stores checkout.
2. branching - videos with call to actions either navigating viewers within the videos, navigating to a url or collection responses. this is only available with onsite’s bubble, embed or offsite.
