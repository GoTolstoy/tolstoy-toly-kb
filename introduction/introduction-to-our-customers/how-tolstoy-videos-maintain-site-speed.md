## How Tolstoy Videos Maintain Site Speed

Tolstoy videos are designed to have minimal impact on your website's speed and performance. Here's why:

### Asynchronous Loading

We utilize a loading technique called asynchronous loading, which ensures that our video script doesn't block or slow down the rest of your website from loading. This means that while our video script is being fetched and executed, your website content will continue to load and render smoothly.

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

We leverage a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver our video script. CDNs distribute content across multiple servers worldwide, optimizing the delivery speed. By utilizing a CDN, we ensure that our video script loads quickly, minimizing any potential impact on your website's speed.

### Minimal JavaScript Execution

Our video script primarily sets a single variable and includes the script URL. This means that the script executes minimal JavaScript code, resulting in a negligible impact on your website's overall JavaScript execution time. It's important to note that any additional functionality or complex operations within the video script could potentially have a slightly larger impact, but we have designed our script to be lightweight and optimized.

We understand that website speed and performance are crucial factors for an optimal user experience. Therefore, we have taken these measures to ensure that integrating our video service into your website has little to no impact on its speed.
